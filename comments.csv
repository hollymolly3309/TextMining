"Well, that's horrible."
"*""For the Swiss Ski family, the tragic death of Sophie Hediger has cast a dark shadow over the Christmas holidays,"" Reusser continued. ""We are immeasurably sad. We will keep an honorable memory of Sophie,"" the CEO added.*"
"Sounds like she and a friend went down a closed black diamond run, and then went into back country from there. So probably no avalanche detection/mitigation had been done there."
"Looks like she was out on a mountain that was closed specifically for avalanche risks. Reminds me of a jarring quote from a documentary I watched on adrenaline junkies. I forget the exact quote but it was something to the extent of:

‚ÄúThe thing about these people is you can‚Äôt stop them. Most of my friends are junkies, and I‚Äôve had to watch a lot of them die. There‚Äôs nothing you can do. They can‚Äôt stop chasing it.‚Äù"
"That's too young. god damn, feel for the family."
"I got caught in an avalanche about nine months ago while snowshoeing. Luckily, I didn't end up buried in snow but I remember all the way while I was carried down that my only thought was how scared I was of dying of asphyxiation under the snow. The fall itself wasn't bad, I was rolling down, sometimes under the snow, sometimes above, but despite the fact that I was carried about 900 ft, I was not injured at all. I heard from people who were buried and eventually rescued that they were still able to breathe, but they were inhaling the same air they exhaled so they just passed out from lack of oxygen but it wasn't a painful experience. I hope that is true and she also didn't suffer."
"I had a friend I made in bush camp when I was younger die in an avalanche. He liked to ski tour by himself in the backcountry. I used to have nightmares about him alive and trapped in the snow slowly suffocating for hours going there was no chance of rescue. Rest in peace Steve, I still think about you."
"On the one hand, she died doing what she loved. On the other, age 26? Damn, so much life left ahead of her..."
"Sounds like she was going off piste on a closed black run that had avalanche warnings. Not trying to victim blame -- just let this be a warning to take these things seriously. You're not invulnerable. These safety and warning systems exist for a reason.

RIP. Heart goes out to the families of her and her friend."
I wonder if anyone ever tried to come up with a suit that has like air bag technology? It would deploy and give some space to have a chance to dig out.
Rest easy cousin Sophie üòû
"This is unfortunately a known risk of the sport.  There's a lot of effort that goes into preventing these kinds of deaths by way of monitoring slopes for avalanche conditions and sometimes triggering an avalanche before it can hurt anyone.  But, these methods aren't perfect and if you spend any time on those high mountain slopes, you are running the risk of getting caught in an avalanche."
"May her soul rest in peace. We‚Äôll be burning a candle for her later today I‚Äôm sure.

There is beauty in dying doing what you love, but there is great tragedy when someone is taken so soon üòî"
Those of you nit-picking her picture need serious help.
That‚Äôs a tragedy to be sure. So very sorry.
My deepest sympathy to her family.
Gosh. That's awful. Dying in an avalanche would just be horrific. Poor girl. RIP Sophie.
"What a loss, really sorry to hear this."
When you die in an avalanche do you suffocate? Freeze to death? Crack your head open?
What an awful way to go‚Ä¶
Oh no..thsts really sad üò¢
Check out the beaver in that pic.
Live by the board die by the board
She died doing what she loved‚Ä¶
She snowboards on the endless slopes of heaven now. RIP
"I swear, people lose the fear of nature and end up in these situations."
"Oh, no.  How horrible for her and the ones that loved her."
shitty way to go too. feel bad for her family
"This will immediately become the most sought after snowboarding run.

A death? On Christmas Eve? Damn the story writes itself."
Absolute tragedy. Condolences to her loved ones.
"One of the worst ways to die, unless it was quick. Merinthophobia, not quite claustrophobia, is more like a fear of being smothered. This one certainly qualifies (I‚Äôm literally taking an Ativan just from thinking about it)."
"Yeah, that's enough internet for today. Fucking sad, man...tomorrow is Christmas, god. What the fuck


Edit: fucking website crying about adblocker lmao"
Died with her boots on at least.
Taken by the very thing she loved.. RIP
Lol. She and her friend went on a closed course and then into the backcountry without prior avalanche detection. Stupid games win stupid prizes.
"People most of the time die that way by going off the piste and on top of that without potentially life saving equipment. 

As tragic as a death like this is as preventable it is too and with that I just can't feel that sorry for those people."
"She did this to her family. She very well knew the risks of entering a closed run due to avalanche warning. She has devastated her family with this poor decision and probably put many others at risk who tried to save her. 

Incredibly selfish."
Gotta pay to play the game.
Died doing what she loved. Outrunning avalanches. RIP
"I know this is a horrible news, but dying in avalanche sounds like a cool way to die"
Hediger and the Angry Fifty Feet of Snow
That‚Äôs weird I was just saying this swiss ski on ice will be what kills me too
[removed]
"*Swiss-Ski said it would keep further details about her death private, as agreed with her family and partner.*

Gotta respect them for not turning her death into a huge spectacle"
I'm sorry for her family's loss.
"Also, avalanche danger in most of the alps has been super high these last few days. On Monday and Tuesday it was 4/5 pretty much everywhere in the mountains."
"Outside of ski patrol bombing particularly risky pitches in backcountry close to the resort bounds. 
There's not likely to be much mitigation done in the backcountry. 

And as for avalanche detection even if they've checked snow reports and followed safe practices carried out a stability test in the area their riding and all have beacons and appropriately trained you can still end up in this situation unfortunately sometimes mother nature strikes. 

Without more info will never know. 

Seems unlikely an olympic athlete wouldn't be well versed in appropriate backcountry etiquette though."
Swiss resorts are different than American ones. There‚Äôs not a fine line between in bounds and backcountry. It‚Äôs more like each town has a lift up into the alps and you‚Äôre on your own. There‚Äôs much less avalanche control.
"Was it in the States or Europe? Standards of avalanche control are *very* different between them.


In the States any open run within the bounds of a resort is avalanche controlled. In Europe (where the trail rating system is different and does not include black diamond designations) anything ""off piste"", which roughly means anything not groomed, is unlikely to be avalanche controlled."
Don't duck ropes
Must have been off piste
"Did you see that in another article? Just curious, the one linked is vague"
"I don't know about where exactly she was, but we had a lot of new snow recently here in Austria, and there were avalanche warnings everywhere.

Here we have a concept called being ""adult"" where you're responsible for the consequences of your actions, so we don't baby-proof every mountain. It is tragic for the family that she died, but if you don't listen to warnings that's kinda what happens. My heart goes out the the mountain rescuers that now have to risk their lives to retrieve a corpse, because that idiot thought she was more skilled than an avalanche."
"People tend to get over confident in their abilities, especially if they are extremely good at something. Unfortunately stopping avalanches on unstable slopes (closed for a reason) once they set off is in nobody's reach.

This was a literal avalanche, but I've seen lots of people fall figuratively more than once, at some point they inevitably bite off more than they can chew. Even had a coworker commit suicide because of a figurative avalanche he caused...

It's all high stakes high rewards but also very risky."
"Ugh. Can only imagine her thinking ""Why the fuck didn't I listen to the cautionary advice..."" If true, what a stupid way to die. Tragic, but also idiotic."
"That's . . . Not what happens when you rebreathe your own air. You would absolutely notice that you were breathing in co2 and not oxygen. The reason your lungs burn when you hold your breath is from the co2 buildup, not the lack of oxygen. You would be in hell rebreathing your own co2 emissions while buried under the snow. That or she was buried under so much snow that she could no longer take in oxygen. 

Hopefully she just got crushed in the avalanche and died of blunt force trauma before she knew what happened. That's the only way to die in an avalanche that isn't excruciating."
"I don‚Äôt think she loved getting caught in avalanches, but then again I didn‚Äôt know her so maybe you‚Äôre right."
"Live by the board, die by the board"
"Turns out no, there‚Äôs not.

Real tragedy. You take that risk as part of the sport, but it‚Äôs still terrible to see."
"I‚Äôve come close to dying by ducking a rope. Never again‚Ä¶forever grateful for my second chance.

I hope in her death, others will think twice about going down closed runs even at the highest levels of the sport."
"It's a tragedy, but it's not like she's a stumbling newbie who accidentally went the wrong way and ended up off piste, she was a professional skier who knew and presumably accepted the risks involved. Almost nothing in life is without risk, and top level athletes wouldn't be what they are if they didn't have a constant drive to push their limits."
"I recently went through two different survival podcasts, Out Alive and Against the Odds, and one thing that stuck with me was just how many cases started with a bad decision that even an amateur would know was risky.¬†


And it makes sense, in a way: if you're out there all the time, chances are that the weather isn't always great, or you'll forget a piece of equipment, or that black run is closed but you know it like the back of your hand so what's the harm? The vast majority of the time, things probably turn out fine despite the unnecessary risk, but it only needs to not go well the one time."
"They've had them for a while. You are kind of kept near the surface by floating above the snow.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt96NFxzhqE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt96NFxzhqE)"
Not a suit but they have avalanche backpacks that inflate instantly. Very common for high adventure snowboarders / skiers to use.
"Imagine surviving 10+ feet deep though and never being found? Would be a miserable, long death. I think I'd rather let the forces of it all just take me out quick. Tough call."
"They exist. They give you buoyancy to basically keep you on top of the avalanche rather than getting pulled under.¬†

I have an airbag motorcycle jacket and they work in a near identical manner, just designed differently for a different purpose.¬†"
"They‚Äôre widely available. As is the avalung. The airbags are designed to keep you afloat. 

These systems do not protect you from debris or other dangers such as impacts and cliffs. 

If I remember correctly, a large percentage of those who die in avalanches die from trauma."
"Backcountry skier here : we do have airbags ! Not everyone as it's expensive, but we do have them and you can pull a trigger that will open an airbag behind you. It's supposed to let you stay on the surface of the avalanche. 

We also carry an avalanche beacon (that will help other device older locate you if you get buried), a shovel and prob to help with rescue. 

We also are trained to analyse risks and to run rescue scenarios and first aid. 

I've never had to use any devices in real life fortunately and try to be as safe as possible."
I don‚Äôt think she loved getting caught in avalanches..
mostly the first and last ones

I now can't unsee this
This seems like a strange comment to throw out into the world on Christmas.
Live laugh love
suffocating under snow sounds awful
Trauma followed by hypothermia and/or suffocation are absolutely not cool.
"It's a very slow, cold, painful way to die."
"When you are caught in an avalanche, the terra firma beneath you turns to liquid and sweeps you off your feet. If you are unable to escape, it quickly accelerates, gathering more mass around it while violently throwing you downhill. If you‚Äôre very lucky, it isn‚Äôt a large avalanche and others are able to spot you, track you if both they and you have a beacon on, and dig you out hopefully within minutes. Many die from the trauma alone of being thrown off ridges or into ravines and rocks (my ski patroller friend once responded to an out of bounds avalanche and she found a body with the ends of his femurs sticking out of the top of his thighs. Hopefully he died in short time). 

Others die a slower death. When the fast moving snow that was as heavy as the equivalent amount of water and debris finally stops moving, you are stuck in whatever position the avalanche contorted you into. But the snow is no longer moving, it is now like concrete, compacted from the huge force of all of that mass + gravity. Even if your lungs didn‚Äôt get filled with snow as you tumbled downhill, you are unlikely to have much space around your mouth to breathe air, and you are unlikely to have free hands to help clear any space to do so. Your moist breath quickly forms a mask of ice around your mouth, and you will eventually asphyxiate from carbon dioxide. If you are lucky to breathe long enough, like through an avalung, hypothermia won‚Äôt take long to set in if rescue isn‚Äôt coming. 

I spend a lot of time in the mountains for fun and understand there‚Äôs an inherent risk to it. Admittedly I‚Äôve had the thought of ‚Äúif I ever died young doing something like backcountry snowboarding, it would definitely sound kinda badass‚Äù. But then I remind myself of these details I‚Äôve learned in avalanche safety classes. Last month, I heard an avalanche from a good distance away while trekking in Nepal and it sounded like a bomb going off. It is definitely not the way you wanna go."
"First the entire ground gives away. You're essentially stuck in a wave that could be actively throwing rocks and ice chunks into you. Desperately try to swim and stay afloat in the equivalent of movie quicksand or oxygenated water, there's no guarantees. This might take you into trees, over rocks, down cliffs, into a crevasse. Then, assuming you haven't died of trauma already, as soon as the snow stops moving it's no longer snow. It's hard pack, the energy of the movement increases density and water content. You have a 0% chance of self rescue, if you could somehow figure out which way is up you literally have nowhere to put any snow you might attempt to move. You're now trapped, possibly upside down, blood pooling in your brain, praying that there's enough air in the pocket to keep you breathing until your buddy can use their beacon to find your location, get out their probe to poke you, and hope you're close enough to the surface they can dig you out before you suffocate to death. 

So does the blunt trauma or suffocation in a claustrophobic ice hole sound cool to you?"
Shes smiling on a podium? What picture are you talking about?
Why? She was an accomplished snowboarder.
not as despicable as you making this into an issue
Why? And why are you replying to this guys comment your opinion of picture choice?
You're sick.
It‚Äôs ‚Äúdespicable‚Äù. At least spell it right
"I have a certified gooner brain, and even I'm wondering why the fuck you'd even notice this."
Only a weirdo would fixate on something like that.
you are so fucking bizarre.
Creepy loser
"Kinda seems like a major teaching moment to me, like what went wrong and why it's so important to be diligent in avalanche conditions when even an Olympic level athlete can get caught."
"I read that as ""this is 110% our fault and we immediately forked over a bunch of money to get them to sign an NDA and release liability"".

EDIT:  this statement is coming from cynical feelings about corporations, not from any actual facts about what happened.  Apparently she went off the standard slopes into an area that didn't have grooming or avalanche control, totally possible it's not the resort's fault at all.  It would be super nice if their silence on the matter was altruistic but even if it is, I imagine it's doing double duty as self-serving."
"Alternative way of saying she contributed to her demise, by being out of bounds and/or triggering the avalanche herself."
"But there can also easily be a false sense of confidence and invincibility by the extremely skilled and/or young.

""It won't happen to me"" and ""I'm good enough to avoid it"" or ""I know what to do so I'll be fine""."
"Another article I looked up said it was in bounds but was closed due to avalanche risk- a run known as ""Run 12""

Not backcountry per se, but it might as well have been if no avy blasting had happened yet.

Also sounds like she wasn't wearing a beacon. Anyone avalanche certified would have had a beacon, shovel, and probe and would have dug her out themselves. Sounds like her buddy went to get others to search for her and it took 2 hours. Im guessing, but all signs point to them being unprepared."
well versed and actually doing it are also different things.
"I do back country. Going off the mountain isn‚Äôt always planned. You see a small run you think you can do and got no gear with you. Do you go or not.

It‚Äôs a choice. Lots of people don‚Äôt realize the magnitude.

I‚Äôve sure done it. It‚Äôs cost me to. Luckily I‚Äôm not permanently injured but lesson learned. But even to this day I duck ropes to hit good lines. Now I‚Äôm more safe about the ropes I duck but it‚Äôs still risky."
"Interesting, thanks"
It was in Switzerland. Arosa.
That‚Äôs what they said‚Ä¶
Thanks Sherlock
Yeah this one cites an initial police report  https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/sports/sophie-hediger-swiss-snowboarder-dead-avalanche.html
"A bit pedantic but you don't exhale 100% co2. You would definitely be able to re-breathe your exhale a few times, but probably not that many (especially in such a tiny space)"
"Seriously, this person had a traumatic experience and literally said they HOPE this reassuring info is true, and you come along like ""nah, it's absolutely horrific. Hope you enjoy nightmares, because if you thought you were having a lot since you almost died, buckle up for them to get so much worse. Merry Christmas!"""
I‚Äôve never felt my lungs burn from holding my breath‚Ä¶
We'll that's not true
I‚Äôm glad your ‚Äúwell actually‚Äù comment has brought peace and happiness to the individual posting a traumatic event.
"This is false information, you don't know what the fuck you are talking about."
A lot of avalanche survivor stories are not like your description of hell at all.
"There will *always* be the ‚Äúwell ackshually‚Äù person on Reddit in every situation, no matter how little that situation calls for their correction."
"Avalanches seem like an awful way to go, too, if you‚Äôre not taken out immediately."
"Easy man, I‚Äôve done some pretty regrettably stupid things at that age it‚Äôs why you read about these things not everyone gets lucky when they have their early brushes with death. Riding in the Rockies which is tame I think compared to the alps I still tried to keep a deep regard for how powerful fresh snow is when disturbed. I also see people who bust down some questionable areas without a thought in the world it‚Äôs wild that some people are inches from death a lot of the time and they are too daft to know it ."
You got me. I assumed she was snowboarding when the avalanche happened. You're technically correct...the best kind of correct.
Are you always this pedantic?
Obviously referring to snowboarding.
"I mean it‚Äôs a funny comment and maybe I react this way, because I could have known her, but I couldn‚Äôt imagine replying in this heartless way to the comment.¬†"
Some heavy Norm Macdonald vibes to this.
"This is sad as fuck but im sorry. People getting killed doing extreme shit in environments humans have to create gadgets and materials to survive in doesn't make make any sense to me.

The levels people of privilege go to for a thrill is fucking beyond me.

Cave Diving. Snowboarding in the back country. Jumping out of a fucking airplane.

I'm only sorry for her family.

Edit: keep jumping out of planes and skiing out of bounds. Natural selection is working as it should. Mf‚Äôs freeclimb and fall off and people are shocked."
"The ‚Äúol‚Äô reddit switcheroo‚Äù has become super annoying when it‚Äôs about stuff like this. I‚Äôm all for dark humor but it got old so fast when so many people try to be funny about this type of subject matter.

I‚Äôm okay laughing at and about death yet this is not funny to me cause the original commenter was not trying to set someone up for a joke, it seems they were sincerely reflecting on this situation.

IDK. Shit just doesn‚Äôt hit anymore, mostly cause it‚Äôs way too overdone and I think people use attempts at humor to avoid authentic interactions with each other, even internet strangers"
Ducking a rope for out of bounds or ducking a rope for a closed in bounds area?
When you are literally an Olympic level snowboarder - you are likely going to be confident and think you'll be ok in any situation.
"I more mean, the point of my comment is not to rag on her. My point is that we should learn from her mistake."
"The logic being that if she had gotten injured and survived she would still have the rest of her life left so the response could have been different. 

In this case she lost her life, so people try to show some respect about the sensitive nature of the subject ‚Äî not all of us are sociopaths like you."
"Go read avalanche accident reports written by professionals. It is the norm not to victim blame. not because of abdication of responsibility but because victim blaming is counter productive if you are trying to teach others how they may make a similar, human mistake."
Not as cool as the one from The World is Not Enough
"One limitation of them is that if you‚Äôre swept through trees, into a gully , over a cliff, ect the airbag makes no difference. You can die of trauma. I still use one but always need to assess risk."
"Yeah I hear ya.. I‚Äôm thinking airbag suit, coming with also some sort of heat pack, and a transponder pinging your location. I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just thinking out loud."
Nice one mr reddit
People are grieving. This is not the time to open your mouth. Learn some decency.

Holy fuck what did bro say
some of yall are complete weirdos man goddamn
"You see how puffy those clothes are, correct?

"Why would that be on Google? Good lord. When you die prematurely, without ever handling your estate, are you going to spend your time in the afterlife bitching about your loved ones who failed to write your will?

It's on GOOGLE. Break up the monopoly! But also run my entire life -- and death! Do my taxes!

Edit: Google's engineers selected that photo after hours of deliberation. Now what?"
This is the comment that gave me enough context to understand what that weirdo must of said
Noticing it is OK... commenting on it in this contex is too much
Holy fuck what did bro say
"As soon as I saw her picture as a thumbnail, I knew the oddballs would be out in full force in the comments."
"Who TF cares my guy, shut your face and go sit in the shitty human corner."
Fuckin brain rot
"W take , well said. I have family that teaches snowboarding on the west coast, I‚Äôll check in with them about this. 
Rest in Peace Sophie."
Lol major ‚Äúteaching moment‚Äù its 2024 teaching is over. weve experienced enough tragedies that everyone should be well aware of the risks by now
Other European media reported she went off piste into a closed area near a resort and triggered an avalanche. Not related to an event or the skiing association.
I too love forming opinions with little evidence to support them
"Swiss ski is the association that manages Swiss ski and snowboard professional athletes, nothing to do with the resort.
She went off piste in an area outside the resort, there had just been fresh snow in the area so the avalanche warning was very high."
"Potentially.

I immediately thought of Kobe's death and the pictures/ME report that circled around online. The public can feel super entitled to this type of information, and I do appreciate those trying to keep those details out of the public sphere, even if it is a way to protect themselves."
You‚Äôre an idiot. Just stop
"Ramblings... You just assumed Swiss Ski either is a corporation or has something to do with a ski resort? And then spew speculation about them bribing and hushing their just deceased athlete's family, who lost their partner and daughter on christmas. Positively nuts, especially given the roughly five seconds of research it takes to discredit this drivel."
Doesn't have to be. In Europe it's common to not turn things in a spectacle.
"Why on earth do people feel the need to shit out completely unfounded garbage opinions about stuff they nothing about?

Swiss Ski is the national skiing federation, has nothing to do with where she went skiing, there is ""liability"" or ""nda"" issue as she went off trail on her own with a friend, and also this isn't america where you can sue for every dumb thing."
winter sports are just also inherently dangerous - sometimes the conditions just have your number. even skiing certain runs at certain resorts in the west (incredibly well trafficked) require that you carry a shovel/avalanche beacon
"This. The normalization of deviance, could have done that run 100s of times before and nothing bad ever happened then."
Thrill-seeking
"It has snowed a ton in Switzerland this past few days, avalanche danger was really high. She is sadly the first victim of the winter here. 

Backcountry skiing in Switzerland is very different from the US, as you can go anywhere you want, but only the Resorts are properly mined to avoid avalanches. So a common scenario here sadly is that she did a run somewhere outside of bounds with a little bit too much exposure and triggered an avalanche. Sadly even with proper gear it's not a guarantee you would survive."
"We don't have certification in Switzerland and you can freely go anywhere at your own risk. It has snowed a ton this past few days and yesterday was a clear weather day, so lots of risks were taken and she is sadly the first victim of the winter."
Risk to reward if that's how It has to be.
Yeah I think it must have been off piste
Must be piste off
"I mean in Europe, off-piste is a thing and avalanches are very rare on-piste."
It‚Äôs true though
"Avalanches can also happen on piste, so it‚Äôs not like their comment is wrong. There was one that claimed a few lives and injured a few others 4 or 5 years ago near where I live."
"While I kinda agree with you that maybe that's not something people might want to hear, it's the truth. I'd rather be told the truth than given false hope. That's just me though, but I know what you mean."
"Better to let them believe a lie? Also, you cannot decide for others of they experienced a situation as traumatic or not"
What should he do? Lie? I hope everything bad happens to you
Never held your breath very long then
"hold it until you physically cannot hold it anymore, and when your body tells you to release, keep holding it in. and your body will try to force you to get it out, but your brain can stop it and continue going. And you'll eventually start feeling the co2 burn."
"Slowly suffocating while encased in hard pack snow and ice, unable to move anything"
"Yeah I hate gotchas like that. We all knew what you meant.


Dying while out doing what you love is at least better than withering away in a hospital."
Ur comment was just super bullshit and i dont know how it has so many upvotes. I lost faith in reddit.
Uhhm yesss‚Ä¶. *Shallow and Pedantic*
Is it really gallows humor if its under pressure?
"Thank you for saying that - the original commenter was clearly not trying to set someone up for a joke, it seems they were sincerely reflecting on this situation."
A callous comment
Doesn't make sense like you wouldn't do the same thing? Or you don't understand why somebody would accept the risk of something that you yourself wouldn't?
"Tracking beacons have already been a thing for a long time: https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/snow-sports/best-avalanche-beacon

Anyone doing serious backcountry riding should have beacons with them along with a crew that can track their location and dig them out.

There are also backpacks that have breathing tubes and other various breathing apparatuses attached to them so if you get buried you can continue breathing longer while the team digs you out: https://gearjunkie.com/winter/safeback-sbx-avalanche-safety-device"
"I‚Äôm listening, Kramer. Please continue‚Ä¶"
Now we're gettin somewhere.
"If youre wearing an airbag backpack, then youre also wearing a beacon which is used by others to locate you. The issue is mostly down to the fact that that deep, you will have a heavy snowpack in front of your mouth and wont be able to breathe. And even if you somehow managed to get your mouth some space, the airbag doesnt help you stay alive because its filled not with air, but with CO2. The heat isnt what gets you in an avalanche, its the air and all the shit you broke on the tumble down. The airbag is exclusively for making you less dense and therefore float and get deposited less deep in the avalanche"
ya we use those. they‚Äôre called airbags and beacons.
"No reason to be a dick right now, mate"
I didn‚Äôt even say anything because it‚Äôs the most peak redditor comment I‚Äôve ever seen. I thought this breed of redditor went extinct years ago. I wasn‚Äôt aware edgy atheist redditors were still around!
"The truth doesn't give a damn about your feels, mate.

Maybe we should stop tolerating such obvious ""prayers and thoughts"" bunk, *especially* when it is very likely (as with many Swiss) that she and her family didn't believe in any of these ludicrously obvious scams.

So, the poster I responded to either considered that or didn't..."
"That's the most downvotes I've seen in a *long* time, maybe ever?"
I think it‚Äôs something about her having a üê´
"Oh, that just says poorly on you..."
"That's on you, creep"
"So weird that you hyperfixated on that immediately, I didn't even notice until I read your comment."
"Bruh that's not even cameltoe, that's just how her loose pants folded over itself"
"You have a porn addiction.

Get help."
"So, let me get this straight. You read an article about her passing away, and looked straight towards her vagina? Yeah that‚Äôs not weird at all."
Something‚Äôs wrong with you
"Yo, what the fuck? Get help"
"Fuck off, pervert"
Inb4 delete because you're the disgusting one.
Wtf. Bodies gonna body. Fucking regarded
Not the worlds fault you‚Äôre a freak
You have a serious problem my friend. Normal adults don‚Äôt care about those kind of stuff. This isn‚Äôt highschool. Embarrassing
"Behold the purest distilled Reddit in the world.

Poor lady though, that really sucks.  People dying at like 26 seems like they are getting extra hosed."
What the fuck
I am dying to know.. something about cameltoe and the person commenting had incel vibes. I was afraid to ask out of respect for the topic but I‚Äôm curious as well
That's what I was wondering too.
"I clicked on the link, and I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the camel toe in the picture they used for this poor girl"
"No because it‚Äôs a body part and not something require commendation nor shaming. She was blonde. Just an accident? Red jumpsuit? Just an accident? White skin? Just an accident? 

See how stupid all those other things were?"
Nope. Only pathetic creeps will have that be their first reaction to this tragedy.
Why do people keep going off piste though? Overconfidence or genuine mistake?¬†
"I‚Äôm currently near the alps, I‚Äôve had avalanche & wind warning alerts appear on my weather app for the past week. The avalanche one said danger to life, be aware. I‚Äôm on the French & Italian side of the alps though not the Swiss side."
"Do you think that having an emergency air like they have sometimes for rafters would help survive an avalanche, or is it mostly being crushed / grated by ice / compacted snow stopping you chest from being able to expand?¬†"
There‚Äôs not certification in the US outside of pros (less than one percent of backcountry users)‚Äîfolks just say certified when they mean they have avalanche training.
Sounds like a closed black diamond run

"Gotcha, I'm just clueless. Thanks for clarifying."
It's also repeating what the comment it replies to says.
"Agreed, I would rather have the truth about most things. Sometimes people protect themselves with reassuring fiction, at least for a while. This one seems harmless because I doubt they'll take extra risks now thinking ""yeah, I could die, but at least it won't be super painful!"" I wouldn't lie to someone about it, but I don't feel compelled to leap up and correct someone who just said ""I hope that's true."""
It's not true though
"""my only thought was how scared I was of dying of asphyxiation under the snow."" You don't read that as traumatic? 

Personally, yeah, I'd let a stranger take comfort in harmless misinformation. I don't think they'll be joyriding avalanches because of it. *Most* people take longer than six months to fully process a near-fatal accident. I wouldn't appoint myself the one to pull off whatever bandaid they're using to hold it together. But whatever. It's reddit. You do you."
"Not able to even tell which direction is up, either. So if you could try to dig a bit, you might end up just digging further down instead of out."
This is nightmare fuel
Not sure if you suffocate first or die of the cold. I'd imagine that your body will sweat a lot therfore increasing hypothermia.
It *insists* upon itself
This is going to be the name of my memoir
"My point was simply that I feel no sorrow for those who risk their lives to do shit they shouldn't be doing. Yeah all you recreational people who think you've conquered a mountain because there is a ski lift and a Starbucks on the side of a fucking volcano.

She was out of bounds. She shouldn't have been there.

Also, people think that because the road to the lodge was plowed must inherently mean its safe to be above 10,000 feet on their day off.

Have fun. I'm all for it. You aint gonna catch me on the outer boundary of a ski zone. But when you fall into a fucking tree well and die, don't be surprised when help doesn't arrive in the time it takes to save a mammal who is throwing themselves down a fucking mountain."

"To be clear even in the atheism sub those kind of edge lords are  pretty well ostracized too. The ""someone told me have a blessed day how could they"" types get some heavy ridicule"
"I‚Äôm an atheist and I also used to be an asshole about it. I still am for the big things (using religion to hate people, strip rights, control people, steal, etc‚Ä¶), but I think it‚Äôs important to let go of the resentment towards people who use religion to make life more pleasant and less scary. I realize that‚Äôs it rare a religious person only takes the good parts, but it‚Äôs ok to give people the benefit of the doubt."
You sound fun to be around

"off piste has a different definition in the US and Europe.

In the US, ""off piste"" isn't a thing, but a lot of people think it means the same thing as ""out of boundaries"". There are some resorts that have OOB locations that are explicitly backcountry but lawful to visit, but you are on your own for avalanche danger and calling for rescue. Ski patrol does not visit this area. However, in most resorts, OOB locations are unlawful to enter because it is too dangerous. So when people hear ""someone went off piste and died"" they think ""why would you do something illegal"".

In Europe, the ""piste"" is just a handful of groomed runs. Off-piste simply means off of the groomed runs. It is lawful to enter these. Most of them are just simply visible from the piste. However, these are also not patrolled by ski patrol, but most of them are heavily trafficked, and some even have established lines to go down safely.

The culture is pretty different. The status of off-piste doesn't really exist in the US because anything that would be off-piste in europe but not very dangerous just gets ski patrolled and becomes officially in bounds, but anything off-piste and dangerous either becomes OOB or backcountry in the US."
"More exciting/interesting/challenging terrain and untouched pow, but obviously requires avalanche training and even with that it‚Äôs obviously much more dangerous"
That‚Äôs where the best snow usually is. It‚Äôs also somewhat different between US and Europe in terms of what you can and can‚Äôt ski at a resort.¬†
"usually the sign says ""no ski patrol, enter at risk"" but it isn't unusual.  I used to do it as a teenager, places like Alta in Utah."
"I think it's more in the realm of overconfidence than anything, though that might not be the perfect term. Think about it: these rules are for the laymen, right? Not us professionals who know how to handle whatever danger we're not even fully aware might exist. /s"
"Going off piste is a level above black diamond.  It is hard to explain, but making your own way in the back country is a level beyond normal resort riding. 

In America, they do some avalanche control off piste.  They don't do anything off piste for Europe, so it is also considerably more dangerous in Europe to go off piste. 

The design of slopes in Europe, off piste is also much more accessible. In America, the whole mountain is mostly on resort.  In Europe, the runs are more like highways and going off the highway is off piste."
"Fresh snow and a lack of awareness of just how common avalanches are. People have this weird idea that snow packs are stable and unstable snow packs are the exception.

Any snow on an incline can avalanche. Fuck, even snow on an angled roof can and will avalanche off. Just typically not a whole mountain side's worth of it at once. If you're on a hill with snow, there's a chance of you being buried in an avalanche."
"Because they are professionals in a sport and they love and live for what they do‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not complicated lol

These people wouldn‚Äôt trade anything for the sport they love. And they aren‚Äôt overconfident, they know what they can handle. But the unfortunate reality is there are things no amount of prep can save you from, like an avalanche. As a human there‚Äôs only so much you can do. Sure going off a predetermined course is more dangerous, but that is what athletes like this live for.  

This is just an unfortunate accident.  Atheletes like this do incredibly boundary pushing things for their sports all year, and push themselves to be the best they can be.  Most of the time they are okay, but all it takes is getting unlucky. Maybe it isn‚Äôt for you at home, but athletes it is their life and they wouldn‚Äôt trade that away. 

Source: growing up participating/competing in many sports and through that knowing and meeting many professional athletes."
Off-piste can be fun as hell for skilled skiers and snowboarders. The problem is that the snow conditions aren‚Äôt controlled by the resort and the terrain can end up really dangerous.
because its fun?
"lol üòÇ 

going off piste is very common. in some places it just means going off groomed runs. in whistler we do avalanche control in these areas. in other places off piste means out of normal ski boundaries. in whistler we sometimes do avalanche control here as well. regardless of definition used, there is a LOT of off piste activity here. it is a regular occurrence. you wanna know where ive triggered the most avalanches? in bounds, in areas that have regular avalanche control bombing. if you want to remove the risk from snow sports, don‚Äôt do them. it‚Äôs sad that she died, and also good that she lived her life on her own terms and did what she loved."
groomed courses are gross. we always take a helicopter up to off piste back country mountains.. it's a whole different feeling. you need a different snowboard too
how's the snow? I'm going in two weeks
"Asphyxiation and trauma are both leading causes of death in avalanches. Airbags are commonly used to assist in keeping riders above avalanche debris but are not always effective.

Source: work in an avalanche forecasting agency."
Black diamond isn't a designation in Switzerland
Couldn‚Äôt you tell from blood rushing to your head?
It‚Äôs recommended that you piss yourself or try to melt snow in your mouth and see which way gravity pulls it.
I saw a documentary where mountaineers said all you need to do is drop some snow or spit and see which way it falls.  Gravity doesn‚Äôt lie
Fuck. You simply saying that makes my heart rate go up about 40bpm.
You suffocate WAY sooner. Avid skiers train in avalanche response which emphasizes quickly digging people out because they‚Äôre generally encased in packed snow and unable to move to dig out or make a hole for oxygen.
"You suffocate fairly quickly.  While the initial snow may be porous enough to allow some air in, your breath is hot enough to briefly melt some of the snow immediately around your face.  As it refreezes it forms a solid layer of ice that air can't pass through.  Once that happens it's over."
"Sharks, I‚Äôm asking for a miracle in exchange for a 50% stake in my company."
crank wont help in this case when under the snow the really scary bit is you cant move at all
"Nonsense. She peddled her own agenda because she thought she was being clever and would get upvotes for it. She didn't consider or even research the beliefs of the young lady who died or her family. It was self-serving reinforcement of indoctrination...and it was clearly a lie.

I would never have challenged the deceased's own family if they had said something of a similar nature because they are A) grieving, and B) have every right to believe whatever they believe.

But when someone else peddles their own lies for their own self-interest, I'm going to call them on it.

And I'm no more an ""asshole"" for doing it than a teacher who corrects a student who claims ""2+2=5"" is.

In short, grow a spine. This is precisely how they come to believe that they have the right to say and commit the ""big things"" you dislike so much."
"I am! But, more importantly, I won't lie to you."
"Nonsense. That's not how proof or reality works. If you are going to claim there's an invisible sky daddy who created the universe, yada yada yada, then YOU need to provide proof of that.

If you do not, then there is no reason for anyone to believe you didn't just make it all up.

And, to date, throughout all of human history, no one has every provided any proof for any of the 5,000+ gods men have pulled out of their asses. None.

You also don't seem to understand the difference between a FACT and an OPINION: 

An opinion is ""I prefer Jazz to Rock"" or ""Red is my favorite color"".

A fact is something that is supported by evidence. It is the only way to ascertain what is TRUE and what is false or imaginary.

The TRUTH is that there are no gods. Why? Because no claims of gods have ever held up to even cursory scrutiny. That's the bottom line.

And, if you were really an atheist (and not just lying), you would know that."

"Off piste in NZ just means ""not on a groomed trail"" (which in some areas is actually quite a lot of the terrain). These areas are patrolled. Backcountry is anything outside the ski-area boundary and such areas are not patrolled and can generally only be legally accessed with the permission of the landowner."
this guy pistes
"I have no idea what Ski Patrol is, but now I imagine CHiPS on snowmobiles. 

I‚Äòve gone off the groomed pistes (sometimes inadvertently) here in Europe. It‚Äôs no big deal. Anything really dangerous will be market by giant catch fences and signs."
Seems like industry standard nomenclature could save lives in these circumstances.
Isn‚Äôt off course pretty much backcountry? Seen too many horror stories lately about going off trail.
"Would an Olympic snowboarder have that training? How could they make such a stupid mistake, knowing how familiar with the environment they are? I‚Äôm sincerely asking, because it blows my mind"

You would need to have light and you could spit to see the direction it falls the other is is if you are upside down you will pass out and die do to blood pooling in your head and chest.
I would try to spit and see which direction it goes.
"Lodged vertically, yes, but if you're laying flat on your tummy, you may not realize."
"It's the fact that if you're in an avalanche you're tossed around and flung around, panicked and scared, and when all that movement stops your panic brain just screams ""DIG OUT"" and you, without thinking much, start (trying to) frantically dig in the direction you're facing.

If you can calm down and think for a second, yes, there are ways to tell your orientation. Spit is probably the easiest one."
"Maybe. Most people panic in situations like this, though."
"The pressure of the snow can push blood around including up to your head.

Ever have someone sit on your body while laying horizontal? You'll get a rush a blood to your head in that case even though you are not inverted."

"Depends where you are. Generally, US resorts keep their off piste terrain avalanche controlled and if you‚Äôre in a region there, it‚Äôs not like backcountry (but sidecountry/area near resorts exists that is not avy controlled). European resorts are very different‚Äîif you leave the piste, you could entirely possibly run into trouble with avalanches or crevasses."
"As a longtime snowboarder, it'scommon to go off piste in the US with no avalanche training. It's not smart to do, but snowboarding is an ""extreme"" sport and people tend to do dangerous stunts for the thrill of it. Also, knowing snow / avalanche conditions is not something you would pick up passively snowboarding at all, you have to seek out specific training for it and even with training, I don't think it's a very exact science if you don't have measurements from all over the slope. Basically, snowboarding and skiing off piste have an inherent risk and the possibility of injury or death just comes with the terrain, especially if you're going alone or without a support team to keep their eyes on you in cases like this."
probably because the people who spend the most time in the back country take the most avalanche training classes
That's exactly why I've never taken any. Don't want to get caught in one.
"You get disoriented too so you get really bad vertigo, and it's really quiet.  So you're spinning uncontrollably and can hear your heart beating like crazy in your head."

I think a lot of it really is 

* having a buddy at all times and never having the whole group on the same slope at the same time (so someone can see you and dig you out) 
* if you see it coming, get to the side as much as possible
* if you're caught in it, try to swim to stay near surface and use objects to help 
* if you know you're going to get buried, getting air into your lungs and keeping hands near face to create a pocket of space + air in the first place (and have your airway clear from snow getting in)
* if you do have that pocket of space, then the spit test may help you"
"You'll die from suffocation long before you pass out and die from being upside down. Iirc over 50% death rate when you aren't dug out within 30m and it drops rapidly from there (which, btw, is why it's so important when back country skiing that every single person in the group is trained in avy rescue. Every second matters).

I've read some caving accidents where the person is upside down (sometimes quite drastically) and survives sometimes for days. Definitely depends on how upside down you are (ie completely vertical vs slightly beyond flat) and other factors like heart health as well, and I'm certainly no doctor so perhaps there are cases of people dying from being upside down less than an hour. I'd put money on the suffocation though."
We all like to think we know what we would do.

"The nomenclature in Europe is universal, whether in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, or France. The discussion about differences was between Europe and the US.

Aside from that, you're talking about a 26-year-old Olympian that had been on the slopes since she was three or four who died in an accident in her home country. This wasn't a case of someone dying because they didn't understand the nomenclature of all things."
As well as make sure there are signs and liability wavers at every corner to reduce the impact of stupid on the locations where stupid happens to get hurt.
"There are snowboarders and skiers who specialize in backcountry snowboarding, often riding helicopters to the tops of mountains where there are no groomed slopes. These people would most likely have avalanche training, but even then there are tons of videoes of these people causing, outrunning, or even getting caught in avalanches. It's just part of backcountry riding and a huge reason why it's considered dangerous. 

Edit: [Travis Rice is a good example](https://youtu.be/MasvoDXQe3U?si=hP6izdUVjeVbIVkp)"
You're imagining that there is any space at all between your face and the snow.  There isn't.
Your mouth would be full of snow and the rest of your body would be encased as well. You can't move down there.
Your mouth would be packed with snow before you stopped moving. There isn't any room to let spit drip.
This orca made the news about six years ago with an apparent act of grieving. Now she has a new baby.
To clarify this is not her first calf after losing the one she carried for 17 days. She had a baby in 2020 that is still alive.
"I remember hearing the story about her carrying her dead calf years ago, and it absolutely hurt my heart. I‚Äôm
glad to hear she‚Äôs got a new calf."
I remember that - I couldn't bring myself to watch it. Nice to see some good news for a change here.
That's great news. Jpod is struggling. Good to see a new birth.
Fuck yeah whale... fuck yeah dolphin
"These whales feel so much, especially this mom grieving. I'm ashamed that companies like SeaWorld exist (i hate even typing their name) that abuse and exploit them. 
Yay about the new baby! üéâ"
"I learned that the mother that carried her calf was the granddaughter of the orca I adopted back in the early 90s. I looked it up for curiosity sake and was blown away... unfortunately Saratoga died long ago, but the connection made me happy. I'm glad she has since had a successful calf, the Southern Residents need as much support as they can get!"
I feel like there‚Äôs info missing in the middle of the headline.
Have we seen whale sex? Sounds terrifying haha
Just have to hope that the pumping in the Cali delta doesn't kill off the whole population now.
"English baby animal names never fail to surprise. ‚ÄúWhy yes, a baby orca is called a calf, just like those baby 4-legged grass-eaters that live on land, why are you asking?‚Äù"
Nature's resilience is both heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time
I've heard that orcas are the smartest non-human species other than their dolphin cousins. Is that right?
Would make the Sky King happy
I just read that Ken Paxton is suing J pod.
The Orcas are now learning Necromancy??  We are so fucked.
"Eh, I'm sure I've done things that were just as weird to get laid."
"Whale, I‚Äôll be! Congrats!"
Baby Jesus whale
"Don't get too excited. The center for whale research that follows this pod said earlier today that there's signs the baby isn't doing well already. Hopefully she pulls through, but don't be surprised if she doesn't."
But unfortunately that 2020 calf is looking thin too. This population of orcas suffers so much. This new calf is not going to survive either. So devastating.¬†
I can‚Äôt imagine at some point when you need to just leave your calf behind
I recently saw a video of a monkey who did the same thing and it was the saddest thing I‚Äôve seen in ages. The baby was pretty much a skeleton and she was still carrying him.
"Hopefully this calf will make it, but the odds are not in their favor. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that there haven't been any successful raising of calves in this pod even a few years before the incident.

Edit: she apparently has had one other calf (born 2020) since the incident that is currently still alive!"
Well the calf is still dead
Does Jpod mean Japan? Are whales in danger because of Japanese fisherman? Maybe not orcas right?
Say hello to your mother for me.
"Btw, orcas aren't actually whales like a Blue Whale or Sperm Whale. They are actually part of the dolphin family and I think they're the largest dolphins that are not extinct.

I believe they are a different family from whales, but they are the same larger classification and it's at the family level that they diverge.

They are apex predators and I have a video of 3 or 4 of them giving a nice display for like 3 minutes on our Alaskan cruise from 2022. We had tail slapping and everything.

There are also small dolphins with the same markings, so when you're right by shore you probably see the dolphins and when you're at sea you're probably more likely to see an orca there."
"Nope, carried dead child, got another child. Seems like a perfect sequitur to me. What could possibly be missing?"
They Yadda yadda'd over the best part
"The first part happened in 2018.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/12/us/orca-whale-not-carrying-dead-baby-trnd/index.html"
"Several years had passed, for some reason the title made me think the Orca had Irish Twins."
"They have weird dicks.


I only know this because of Black Fish and the weird ""trainer jacking an orca off"" clip they inserted."
"As a mother that lost a baby, I can say that I feel this is pretty damn universal. 

The feelings I had towards the disposition of my baby‚Äôs body were‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..for lack of a better word, quite feral. I was unconscious when they took her. It was good for them I was. That would‚Äôve been really unfortunate for all of us to go through if I hadn‚Äôt been. 

As it was, I still spent *months* obsessing, wishing I had died with her in my belly, so I could ‚Äúprotect‚Äù her forever. Nonsense. Stark raving mad nonsense."
What a sad thing.
"She's a mom to two other orcas in the pod since 2020, so says the article. So it seems at least 2 babies are still alive?"
She also has a 3yo J57 who is still alive
"While they have had some recent calf deaths, there were two newborns in 2023 and they are still alive today."
...this guy....
"It‚Äôs the name of the pod. There are 3 pods that make up the southern residents (whose native waters are in the PNW): J pod, K pod, and L pod. They‚Äôre in danger because there is not enough food for them, with their main diet being chinook salmon which are also endangered."
"It‚Äôs just an alphabetical classification.

J pod hangs out in the northern pacific, near Canada and Alaska."
This whale is a member of j-pod family. They live in the strait of Georgia and the Salish sea on the west coast of Canada. Their numbers a dwindling due to competition with sea lions and fishermen and other factors.
Oh cool! I can see the dolphin similarities now that you say that. I'd love to see them in the ocean but I also like to respect the ocean from a distance üòÖ
"Well, she could have possibly snuck into the maternity ward and stole another orca baby."
Was there cake?
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
"Take an Alaskan cruise in the early summer like the first week or two of July and I believe that's one of the best times to see them, it's not cold (50s and 60s) most days, and it's the safest way to go out on the ocean."
Dead salmon hats were doffed and thrown in the air. As is the custom.
The cake is a lie
"Uh, no, that‚Äôs not included in the narrative. It‚Äôs very simple and clearly spelled out."
"I mean, I've seen enough clips to know that you can't tell if the baby was cake until you cut into it..."
Followed by a game of seal volleyball
"Let me guess, it‚Äôs selective dementia, and just happens to be about what happened between him and his accusers!"
Wow he looks like that orc captain at the siege of minas tirith¬†
Guess we can‚Äôt convict him now. Oh well. We‚Äôll get the next rich rapist I‚Äôm sure.
"Nah, fuck that, lock his ass up."
"I never knew what this guy looked like, but I remembered he said something stupid and looked up the quote.

>

>""In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. We go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong in our clothes, and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely. That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that."""
Isn't that convenient.
He didn‚Äôt have dementia when he was doing what he‚Äôs accused of doing so I don‚Äôt really give a rats ass. A precedent has to be set. Throw the book at him.
"Ah!
What we call the ‚ÄúErnest Saunders‚Äù defence. 

(He claimed dementia to get out of jail then magically got better)"
Sex trafficking is still illegal for people with dementia
Scientists are baffled at the correlation between felonies and the emergence of debilitating illnesses among the wealthiest 1%.
"Dementia and affluenza for the rich.

Lifetime prison with no parole for everyone else."
"Mental Illness does not excuse crimes against other people. Hes a danger to society, even more now that dementia has taken hold and hes an actual lunatic now. I have no remorse for these scumbags. May his victims dance on this filth's grave."
Surprise surprise now  he gets to be put in an old folks home sexually harassing the staff and other guests..
What a creepy picture. Dude has major stranger danger vibes.
Can't Junior Soprano yourself outta this one.
"Dementia? Rapist?


Let's get this man into Congress ASAP!"
"Too much dementia to be held accountable, but not enough to keep ‚Äúworking‚Äù as a CEO."
"If having dementia doesn‚Äôt preclude you from serving in the House of Representatives, it certainly shouldn‚Äôt be a valid reason to escape legal repercussions."
The one who said fat people were gross?
what the hell is it with some of these people and SEX TRAFFICKING??!!! Does having too much money make you sick in the head?!
Being in a prison geriatric memory unit.......not a good way to go....
He didn't have dementia when he entered a not guilty plea in October though so he got dementia in 2 months...
Reminds me of Harvey Weinstein showing up to court with a walker. I didn't buy it then and I don't buy it now.
Either they start punishing these rich elites or they will find out that Luigi has many extended family members.
Gary Busey about to get one last role
"The rich finding all kinds of ways of staying out of prison.

They should sentence him regardless, cause he was fine when he committed those crimes."
"I don't care, throw his ass in jail. He can be confused behind bars just as much as he can at home."
"How convenient.

Let‚Äôs let independent neuropsychiatrists testify to this."
He didn‚Äôt have dementia when he was doing it; how beneficial that his brain has a degenerative condition now that he has to pay the piper
Church lady voice: ‚ÄúHow conveeeeeenient‚Äù
Dementia? Luigi will fix it for you!
Well prison would be perfect for him. Won‚Äôt have to wander around looking for him if he‚Äôs locked in a cell.
It‚Äôs always who you medium suspect
"Lock him the fuck up anyway, plenty of sick poor people in prison. Fair treatment all around"
Should make it easier to do his time.
"Damn, it's going to suck having dementia in prison."
Thoughts and fucking prayers
Dementia and catastrophic Botox face
"If you use these kinds of claims to avoid trial, you should be forced to go into a state run health facility for that condition. 

So let him go to a state mental hospital until he dies."
Old creepy fucks ü§ù pretend dementia
He looks very different than those models he picked for his company.¬†
That's nice he can forget about his crimes in a prison cell
Funny how charges do that.
"So what? What does his current condition have to do with punishment for crimes committed when he didn‚Äôt have dementia? If you don‚Äôt remember the crime, you can‚Äôt be punished for it? The fuck?"
Did he come out as Christian already or is that now step two?¬†
So? Put him in prison... Tell him it's a playground
And? They still need to lock him up.
"Seize assets for the victims. He has dementia, he won‚Äôt know what happened to the money anyway"
"if they lock up pregnant ladies, then they sure as hell can lock up a crazy old man."
He wasn't demented when he did this shit. Convict him for what he did and let him rot in prison and wonder why he's there.
"Sex trafficking, old, and has dementia? They should run for congress, they'll fit right in."
Let his demented ugly ass die in prison then. We don't give a fuck.
How can he plead not guilty if he doesn't remember ü§∑
He‚Äôs checking all the boxes now. Time to run for Congress!
Someone should really investigate all the sex trafficking rings in west palm beach.
Well luckily for him dementia will make prison super tolerable compared to how it is for the people there without dementia so there's that......
He can still serve jail time if found guilty
What a convenient timing
Is dementia a side effect of sex trafficking? Correlation seems very high.
I have heard that one of side effects of dementia is committing trafficking I just didn‚Äôt know what type until now. The more you know.
"The ole dementia plea. Does this dumbass not get when he gets sent wherever for a sentence what's gonna happen? Pleading dementia gets him in a low security facility. The kind of place where sex traffickers meet a very nasty end due to low security.

Go ahead dumbass. Any route you take is gonna result in death during incarceration. 

Let's hope it's caught on video."
"Oh okay, he is totally forgiven then!"
He‚Äôs got a serious case of the Corrado Sopranos
Prison sentence-induced dementia? Only seems to happen to wealthy scum bags.¬†
You may claim that I did fucked up shit... But I don't remember. Check mate
So he just doesn‚Äôt remember all the shitty things he did? K
"Okay, dementia prison it is."
"Oh, the one who said he only wanted beautiful people to wear their clothes.  I remember this freak."
Nah fucc that put his  ass in jail
Sounds prime for Trump‚Äôs cabinet
"How convenient, the health problems always materialize after the indictments. When you're wealthy and powerful, at least."
"growing up my mom always said powerful men accused of wrong doing never admit guilt or take accountability they will just claim to be ill and fade away 

i always thought she was just being dramatic but the older i get the more i see it 

him, weinstein, tom girardi to name a few"
Funny how these rich guys approaching trial always get dementia.
"Ah yes, the Jimmy Snuka defense. If Trump didn't win, he'd be using that too. 

""You can't prosecute me, I'm too old."""
He looks like deadpool with a blonde wig.
Likely story!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Likely story!
"Oops, ya caught me. Who am I again?"
"Oh, poor him. He should have come down with something worse"
"Oh poor guy, he doesn‚Äôt get to revel in his dark memories.  I don‚Äôt wish dementia anyone  as terrible as the affliction is but karma comes for us all one way or another"
"He has Kenneth Copeland eyes. Dementia or not, he's evil."
Aww and Weinstein has heart issues. Now take your dementia riddled pedoass to jail.
Ah the good old get out of law and order free card.¬†
Predictable diagnosis and timing. Means he knows he will be convicted.
Funny how these rich creeps think these sudden convenient illnesses will make anyone sympathetic towards them.
"On a plus, he won't notice he's in prison."
"Put him in prison until he dies, and every time he's lucid read his charges to him again."
"Why is it that most of these freaks that get caught look EXACTLY how you'd expect them to. This can't be a coincidence. 

You just take one look at em and you know something is wrong with them and then years later you find out they killed their whole family or do shit like this guy"
Fry that motherfucker!
I wonder how much they paid for that diagnosis?
"That was going to happen with Trump if he had lost the election. For every case against him, they would've brought out the dementia card to protect him."
Sweet‚Ä¶what government position will he get next year?
Riiiiiiiiight. Dementia...{*wink*wink*}
How very inconvenient.
"Convenient that. Regular Joe won't skirt a conviction because of mental incapacity--hell, they have put people to death who were incapacitated worse than this waste of oxygen. He can spend his life in a confined setting away from his luxurious shit as far as I am concerned."
"Here's a list 238 prestige doctors who say the rich white guy is suddenly, tragically inflicted with dementia. 

Cue the dementia harpies rallying to this human traffickers defense."
Oh that‚Äôs crazy. Good thing the woodchipper doesn‚Äôt require you to be of sound mind
"Not defending him but the title is disingenuous.

‚ÄúA doctor concluded that testing ‚Äúyielded diagnostic impressions that Mr. Jeffries currently suffers from dementia with behavioral disturbance ... Alzheimer‚Äôs disease with late onset (probable) ... and Lewy body dementia,‚Äù the filing states.‚Äù 

A neuropsychologist came to this conclusion. The lawyer relayed his analysis."
"Damn, I guess prison is gonna suck even more for him then.


Just kidding, laws only apply to the poor."
So‚Ä¶45.2‚Äôs pick for commerce?
Ah well. He won't remember rotting in Prison.
Sex trafficking ? Dementia ? Looks like he‚Äôs good to become the next president.
"I'd say he had it in the 1990's. He's got that Busey madness. Doesn't excuse his behavior, it's more of a brightly lit flashing warning sign."
"Oh, just in time for court. Good one."
"Well my dad has vascular dementia AND Alzheimer's, and he didn't sex-traffic anyone."
What a coincidence. Luigi Mangione has dementia too.
Who gives a fuck? He didn‚Äôt have dementia when he was trafficking women. Straight to the gulag with this shit bag.
Well. It worked for Ron Jeremy.
Hey look insight into the Trump defense if we had a functional justice system.
Should still got to jail
give luigi 5 min with him
"Good news!

We can still lock him up and he will be convinced it's his real home!"
"Same as always then. The rich only get their commupence either when they're already dead or on deaths door.

Why has it taken so long to prosecute.

It was the same with Jimmy saville. Worshiped until the day he died and then suddenly every news publisher in the world turned. Do it earlier. Have these people actually pay for their crimes whilst they still can instead of always waiting until they're on deaths door.

This is them just winning. A lifetime of molestation only to be let off on medical grounds. It's sick.

I'll put money on Rupert Murdoch being the next one announced, but only after he's buried.

I don't hope for an afterlife in order to have some sort of existence afterwards, but so that these absolute cretins can actually receive some justice that they should have rightfully received long back before they could cause even more harm. Justice system is fucked."
"If he has, that's great. Convict him anyway.

If he hasn't, that's great too. Convict him and he can enjoy prison even more.

Nothing about this changes what he did and he should get no special dispensation now he's managed to find a pet doctor to diagnose him with whatever he wants him to."
Because of course he has dementia right now after all this
"The podcast, The Big Flop, did a very interesting take on him‚Ä¶ https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-big-flop/id1701817343?i=1000677920017"
We always seem to get these people too late in life‚Ä¶ there needs to be more diddy and rkellys out there that need to be locked up in their prime.
"Well, he can just be confused every day he wakes up in prison and has no idea how he got there."
"But the question is , did he have dementia when he sex trafficked? How can you mount an operation like that while suffering dementia? Come on, what a stupid excuse"
I want him to learn every single day that he's in prison for what he did
"Ahh yes the Weinstein ""but this man is so old and frail, you can't hold him accountable for being a monster"" defense."
Sure worked for Weinstein when he started getting ‚Äúsick and fragile‚Äù during his trial.
Same type of thing Harvey Weinstein did... Walked in hobbling on crutches and looking old and frazzled... just a ploy to gain pity from the court system.
Then prison for him will be an all new experience every day for the rest of his life.
Okay. So whats that got to do with sex traffick?
He can have dementia in prison then. What‚Äôs the big deal?
"Who cares. Jail.¬†


Oh wait, he's rich. Okay let's just forget this all happened and leave that poor, innocent old sex criminal in peace.¬†"
A hammer can solve this problem.
Then he should be happy to know that federal penitentiary comes with free government healthcare.
Officer...I uh... didn't know I couldn't do that...
So what? He'll wake up in a seemingly new place everyday. He did the crime(s) so nobody cares.
"Ok but he's the same person, ain't no one letting out death row inmates because of this silly defense."
He needs a mangione in his life
"Is it Junior Soprano dementia? Like, the kind he had before real dementia set in?"
So he's not denying it then. Sus.
He's demented no doubt
"Isn't that the guy who was obsessed with selling to the ""cool kids"" or whatever"
"If untrue, his lawyers need to be disbarred. I'm sick of ""lawyers"" just outright lying to ""win"" rather than follow the law. There needs to be consequence for this shit."
I mean even if he has dementia he can have dementia in prison like everyone else serving life sentences.
Oh no! We'll let his cellmate know.
all these rich criminal white guys getting away with crimes.
Luigi knows what to do
Abercrombie and Filth strikes again
How confident. Prosecute that POS to the full extent of the law.
"Don‚Äôt care, put him behind bars in a shitty state run aged care. Take his privilege."
"Ah, good to see the old favourites being hauled out and taken for a spin‚Ä¶"
"And if he's not convicted due to ill health, he'll make an amazing, miraculous recovery, the 1st ever!"
Doesn‚Äôt matter. He was fully aware when he did the crimes.
"The good news is, that Trump is about to give him a cabinet position."
"Send him to prison and don't remind him why he's there. It'll be fun for him to find out for himself every day.

Or do the honourable thing and put one in his ear. Dementia is no way for anybody to go."
Just like Junior Soprano‚Ä¶
"Cool, guess prison is gonna suck with dementia"
"So what? He didn‚Äôt have it when he committed these crimes, let him rot in prison unable to understand why he‚Äôs there or what‚Äôs going on, I‚Äôm sure his roommate will explain things once the lights go out."
"Cool, he can wake up confused in prison every day. Fuck him."
"so tell him his prison cell is his mansion, what's the problem?"
"My grandmother has dementia and has, to my knowledge, trafficked zero people, so I don't see how this is relevant."
"As long as dementia isn't a disqualifier for federal office, it's not an excuse to commit a felony."
"Hey look it's the American justice system working as intended!

It's just like the last line of the pledge of allegiance, ""With liberty and justice for the rich, now fuck off and get back to digging that ditch!"""
Unpopular opinion: IDGAF. Let him rot in prison. It doesn't matter of he knows why now. He knew exactly what he was doing when he did it.
Ofc he has. A healthy person can‚Äôt do this sh#t.
Who cares? He would've walked anyway. Punishment is only a poor person thing in America.
wait didn't the man that was choked out on the train have mental issues? and him being choked to death was celebrated
Dementia and sex trafficking are political platforms. This was a campaign announcement.
"Believe it or not, straight to the presidency."
When you have dementia they let you do it.
So he won‚Äôt know he is in prison. Perfect.
"This should have been caught earlier.  $80 for a T-Shirt in 2001 should have been a red flag.
."
"I mean you can have dementia and be president, raegan, trump, biden, all have massive cognitive impairment. If you can be president you can stand trial, fuck this dude."
"Then let him have dementia in prison.

Also, anyone also noticed how Harvey Weinstein also suddenly needed a walker once he was being charged?"
"Too fuckign bad, jail him anyway. His victims deserve justice and since they aren't going to get that, give them retribution."
"Well, stick his ass in prison anyway- he won't know he's there."
Junior Soprano already did this!
"Fuck that shit! Lock his evil ass up anyway. I‚Äôm tired of these fucks living lives of complete and utter selfishness, destruction, chaos and exploitation. Only to grow old and develop ‚Äúdementia or cancer or some other fucking disease‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt allow them to be held accountable.  Fuck him, he hurt/destroyed a lot of people before he became demented. No quarter!"
He can wake up in a new cell every day.
I've learned that in the usa you can pay to play when it comes being a pedo and a rapist.
I feel morally superior for never buying from that shitty store.
Good he won't realize he is in prison.
Perfect time to be put in prison.
Another millionaire evades consequences...fucking hell
They can put him in a hospital like jail and seize his assets.
I'm sure they would take good care of his condition in prison.
"Isn‚Äôt this the guy who went viral a long time ago for saying fat and unattractive people should be wearing A&F clothes?

Welp."
"Oh man, that sucks.  Reprocessing the fact that you‚Äôre in jail over and over again"
"Imagine being a predator your entire life and finally showing your cowardice at the end of your life.

Pathetic."
"Okay? Someone who is so far too mentally unfit to pay justice for their crimes should not be free to go. Because all of these old pedophile rapists are being caught after a lifetime of abusing their power and this ‚Äúdementia‚Äù defense will continue, he should be placed in an assisted living facility for the rest of his life. All of his wealth should be transferred to the facility as well, just like with other private citizens who have not committed heinous crimes against society. 

You can give up your money and go live in a nursing home or you can serve time for your crimes. Why are we giving wealthy white men more outs? He‚Äôs had a lifetime, he has no guilt and he has paid no toll. Time to lay in your bed you piece of shit."
That‚Äôs the best they could come up with?
"Weird, didn't charge him as a terrorist"
Well beats the usual perpetrators walk with a cane or a wheelchair that seems to be obligatory for high profile sex offenders.
"I wouldn‚Äôt wish dementia on anyone. 

Well‚Ä¶ maybe just him."
Good grief. Is the piece of shit fit for trial? Is he in custody now? Can he go to a prison mental hospital? Or something like it? He needs to be held accountable. This is bullshit.
The Ronald Regan defense.
So if you aren‚Äôt rich and have dementia do you still go to jail? This is just another way they keep rich people from being accountable for their own actions. There is no way out of this mess we‚Äôre in unless we force accountability on these people. The law either needs to be equal for all or eventually we will be forced to balance the scales ourselves.
Fitting punishment would be having to rediscover your in jail because you‚Äôre a monster daily. As much empathy as I have for those dealing with dementia I have a lot more towards victims
Seems like he‚Äôs always had some form of it because this man would say some unique stuff when interviewed.
Lock him up...don't need a demented sex trafficker on the loose
Ahhh  the ol dementia trick‚Ä¶.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt know I was not suppose to enslave women and then pimp ten out cause I‚Äôm old and demented‚Äù
"So, Secretary of Commerce nomination?"
Dementia isn‚Äôt going to make him any safer to the public.
So he's going to pull an [Ernest Saunders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Saunders) then?
Oh well. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt have dementia when he did all those things back then.
So? He can have dementia in jail.
Dementia doesn't make you sex traffic
"Didn't the same ploy happen with a Dentist who tortured and destroyed children's mouths not long ago, where the defense used this ploy to get him out of sentencing?  Ah yes, this dentist right here [https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/crime/2018/02/28/charges-dropped-against-controversial-jacksonville-dentist/13984639007/](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/crime/2018/02/28/charges-dropped-against-controversial-jacksonville-dentist/13984639007/)"
The stock defence for rich predators
"He has dementia:( he‚Äôll be suffering from it in a non extradition country 

On a beach 

With a mai tai"
"Man they caught this guy in west palm beach, seems to be a lot of high profile sex trafficking from that area for a while now."
"Good, throw his dementia havin ass in jail."
That‚Äôs not a fucking excuse
"Well, that‚Äôs one way to try and get off."
"I watched a documentary once that alleging psychiatric disorder puts you in an even worse rabbit hole than jail. But I'm sure his lawyers will be able to pull an ""at home care"" instead of a psych facility."
Look are CEO once he charged with a crime got magic dementia that seams totally legit
"How convenient to suddenly have ""dementia"""
"Cool. People with dementia can also be locked up. Is it ethical? Probably not.

Is it ethical to let this man get away with his crimes due to dementia? Definitely no.

Put him in a memory care facility and put a police in street clothing to watch over him to make sure he doesn't escape."
Fuck! The ravages of time got him before we did!
i mean is withholding something like that in a publicly traded company fraud of some kind? shouldn't it be?
Then he won't mind spending the rest of his life in prison
Real end of Casino vibes
The old Vinnie the Chin defense.
Well then prison will suit him just fine.
"Boo hoo, to gen pop he goes"
"‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an Abercrombie?‚Äù

Him, most likely‚Ä¶.."
Then he would mind when we depose him.
He can have dementia in prison.
He's not going to Wendy Williams wiggle his way out of this one.
Should we give him a tax break?
Releasee the brain scans! Dont believe these rich fools!
We waited too long. All these old fucks got away with it
">has dementia

That sucks. Anyway, when's the hearing?"
Take his money and distribute it to those he affected.
"Kind of like when Rick Hendrick was in court for business fraud THIRTY YEARS AGO pretending to be a cancer patient facing death. 

He‚Äôs fine by the way. Made a miraculous recovery as soon as the trial was over."
"A new take on the classic defense of ""I'm rich, oopsie"""
"Just had a rapist priest try to pull that in New Orleans, still sentenced him to life‚Ä¶.although he deserves much worse"
Argh! Affluenza strikes again!
Happens every single time. CEO of Future Electronics now mysteriously has Parkinsons right around the time of his court date.
Remember how Harvey Weinstein suddenly became all frail and ill for his rape trial?
Dementia? At this time of year? At this time of day? In this part of the country? Localized entirely within your kitchen?
Let him be confused in prison then.
"And we should just let him off the hook because he's dealing with such a massive hardship. 

/s"
Shoot um
"Isn‚Äôt that orc supposed to be based on another rich rapist, Harvey Weinstein?"
"Gothmog, what a great comparison"
Harvey Weinstein?
Picture please
He really does!
He looks like the [Lego Davy Jones head](https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/PN/2/3626pb0632.png)
Always has.
I was thinking a guy who bobbed apples in a bee hive
That‚Äôs the first thing that came out when he claimed A&F wouldn‚Äôt provide larger sizing because it‚Äôs just for ‚Äòattractive people‚Äô
"And this is the guy who said he ""didn't want ugly people wearing his brand"" lmao"
This made me laugh out loud
"Next time for sure!!

 *now get back to work*"
Not if he just runs for president. No.
Send him to prison and tell him it‚Äôs Epstein Island. He won‚Äôt know the difference if they‚Äôre telling the truth.
"Of course we can convict him, the diagnosis just makes it funnier"
"A fucking CEO, former or not, needs more money so much that he gets involved in sex trafficking? Must be true, CEOs are truly underpaid. /s

If we can‚Äôt convict him, can we at least seize most of his assets and use it to fund anti-trafficking task forces? He‚Äôs got dementia apparently so bad he can‚Äôt be punished for his crimes, so I guess he wouldn‚Äôt notice he‚Äôs being cared for in a shitty nursing home."
[removed]
"We can‚Äôt unfortunately. He‚Äôs running for president now. 

Dementia and sexual assault charges are now huge turn on for the resume for presidents apparently."
He can be demented in prison. I am sure it happens to poor people often enough.
"Looking at his picture and reading this, I would bet $5000 he was definitely one of the second group, and spent his whole life stewing over it and obviously getting his revenge on some people by proxy.

Total fucking loser.

LOLz, looked up some older pics. He looks like a total cementhead who needed cue-cards to get dressed in the morning. I doubt he'd be let into any A&F store."
"Says Gothmog

https://imgur.com/a/eLtUdKS"
"This quote is always amusing to me because I do remember a brief period where A&F was everywhere. But it became *uncool* incredibly quickly. Because all the graphics they came up with were ultimately tacky or offensive or both. Soon the only ones still in A&F were the assholes with trashy personalities, and that was brand poison."
The embodiment of ‚Äúit‚Äôs always the ones you suspect the most‚Äù
What an absolute twat.
And those people made him rich because they subscribed to that too.
And then he goes around with a mug like that.
"He was on the frontpage of reddit more than a decade ago which has the best description of him ever as the title.
  
[""I present to you Mike Jeffries, CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch. Too ugly to work at his own stores.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1dxs09/i_present_to_you_mike_jeffries_ceo_of_abercrombie/)"
Since back when I was only 10 years old I thought the brand was douchy without even knowing the term douchy meant.
"Is dementia caused by bad plastic surgery? This reminds me or Harvey Weinstein suddenly needing a walker when he was going to court. Everyone knows he doesn't have dementia, he's just an arrogant bastard that think he can get away with claiming to have it. Lock him up."
"Seriously.

So hypothetically, I invade a home that isn‚Äôt mine and murder someone in cold blood. I trip on the stairs on my way out the door and fall on my head and supposedly can‚Äôt remember committing the crime. Does that mean I just shouldn‚Äôt be held responsible for the crime?

Fucking bullshit defense."
His victims sure remember it.
"I mean, a precedent has been set. They get away. If they're rich and powerful, they get away with it, nine out of ten times."
I was gonna call it the Uncle Junior defense.
The only person in history to make a full recovery from Alzheimer's. He should have been vivisected for the benefit of medical science.
"Lawyer here. Without commenting on this particular case, it's an established principle in the American jurisprudence system that you can't prosecute someone who is not currently mentally competent. It's considered a due process violation because the person can't meaningfully participate in their own defense. Generally in such a case, the person is evaluated to determine their current condition and if they can be brought back to a competent state with treatment. However, with an irreversible condition like dementia, they would just need to be managed so they're not a threat to others or themselves."
"Uh yeah, this. Dementia doesn't mean he just forgets. It means parts of his brain aren't responding anymore and sometimes those parts of the brain are fun ones like impulse control and emotional control. So now he might not just be a violent rapist, but an unpredictable one.¬†"
Dementia isn't a mental illness. It's a neurological disorder.
"Firstly, dumb take on mental illness, which dementia even isn't one.

Secondly, that's not the point. Standing trial with dementia is going to be... complicated."
"He reminds me of Jimmy Savile. All he needs is to grow his hair long, put on a gaudy tracksuit, and smoke a cigar."
He'll see Return of the King playing and wonder why he's on the TV.
That is almost everyone on the internet to be fair /s
"Yes, it also apparently makes you believe you have nothing better to do than ruin other people's lives, instead of enjoying or positively utilizing wealth. Everybody with any sort of wealth tends to be an absolute wretched human. I've noticed a lot of people let even 70k get to their heads and ruin their mind.

You need to be competent to stand trial. That is the issue. You have a due process right to assist in your defence. If they can't conduct the trial in a way that doesn't violate your constitutional rights then they can't conduct the trial. If his condition is accurate then there is unlikely to be any way to return him to competency.

>Further, if the diagnosis is true, he will never stand trial, because competency will not be restored barring some major medical breakthrough to reverse dementia.

Even if we found a way to reverse dementia, it would only really be applicable to cases where it was super early onset. As any brain damage, or warping to the brains functions cannot be reversed.

i have a 70 something year old immigrant coworker and he was telling me how he was protesting the government or dictatorship in college and making molotov cocktails and was on the run so he wouldn‚Äôt be arrested and then hit me with the ‚Äúi came here legally so they should too‚Äù
"My grandfather came from Sicily poor as hell. He said we came by ocean because we had no choice.

"Oh, I know, and I'm not thinking of the poor wartorn refugees escaping genocides around the world when I say that, I know it's primarily the legal immigrants. They're not sending us their best, I once heard a feller say.

"Sorry you were down voted, you're absolutely right"
He said he was shocked by it. If I heard all that racist shit then surely he has too from his constituents. Did he miss all the Trump flags too? I was aware of who he was i keep up on local news.
Technically they didn't say a significant portion of the population.
Yes every US state has skeletons. Our nation was founded on slavery. I never said my state was better because its not I can promise you that. Just acknowledge that our entire nation has an extremely racist past without throwing a fit at the person telling you.

"Homeless. Struggling in New York. Innocently fall asleep on the subway. Get lit on fire and burn to death, no doubt without fully realizing what was happening. Damn. Hard to even imagine."
No need for the Mayor of NY to look this guy in the eye.
Where's Eric Adams? I can't see him in the picture.
is he in a straightjacket?
"I accidentally saw a few seconds of the video and it‚Äôs horrifying tbh even in the few seconds I saw there‚Äôs people just like walking past and no urgency from anyone including the person recording to do anything. 

It does show the dark side of the fast city life where everyone is too bothered with their own things going on to care about something happening to anyone else and also the phone and social media culture now where people would rather record something than intervene and don‚Äôt feel a real connection to other people."
"Saw this headline earlier - sheesh

""Suspect accused of burning woman to death on NYC subway is previously deported illegal immigrant"""
That video shows the lowest of the low on modern society. Sick and sad.
He is an illegal immigrant too
"Fuck this scum.

Give him the death penalty."
Brought to the courthouse escorted by 0.1 Luigi Mangiones worth of armed police officers.
Give this thread about an hour before it gets locked
"In principle, I am against the death penalty.
That said, there is an exception to every rule.
Of course, they should give him a fair trial first."
Terrorism charges? Death penalty? Or is that only when rich CEO's are murdered?
This guy is way more of a danger to the public than Luigi.
"Sometimes, the death sentence is ok."
"Homeless people experience depraved acts of violence on the daily. Homeless women face higher incidents of violence than men. That incident increases if you are disabled and/or queer. Im not unfamiliar with homeless people committing acts of violence toward each other that results in someone's death. This is a case of gender-based violence that is really common among the homeless. Powerless people committing atrocious acts toward other powerless people. I'm sure some might pretend to care cause he's a violent undocumented immigrant or cause he's a man attacking a woman. I just see so many preventable issues with a better system in place. May this woman rest in peace.

I also want to point out:


New York Gov. Kathy Hochul office said in a statement crime rates have decreased by 10% since the governor introduced a subway safety initiative in May, and by 42% since January 2021. But numerous high-profile violent incidents have continued to cause anxiety among residents regarding their safety on the subway system.


I believe the high profile cases are almost always vulnerable groups: homeless and the poor, disabled, elders, queer. Sometimes the people within these vulnerable groups are fighting each other. Sometimes a classed individual ""gets rid off the nuisance"" in public. Either way, all of this is so sad and heartbreaking."
"As a Guatemalan American with undocumented family, fuck this guy. Hope he rots in jail."
"Woman gets set on fire and suffers possibly one of the worst ways known to die, and all you people can do is crack mayor and ceo jokes.

Disgusting."
"no perp walk, no terrorist charges.......no billionaire....i see"
"IMO they should investigate anyone who meets all the criteria of being illegally here, homeless, and a substance abuse issue and deport them immediately. People who meet all these overlapping categories are likely to be very dangerous."
Mind you the police did nothing and walked past the victim.
Weird how he doesn‚Äôt have 20 dudes flanking him with M4s
Where's the mayor? I thought he escorted all the murderers to court?
"I still don‚Äôt understand why the cop walked past by. They are saying he was securing the crime scene. I‚Äôm sorry what? Just throw a damn jacket on her to put out the fire, then you can secure the damn crime scene."
Due to overcrowding he was released on bail
All the people defending this guy are disgusting. Just because he is poor and from a bad place doesn‚Äôt justify what he did.¬†
"What will right wing media do?

The assailant is an undocumented migrant, but the victim was a homeless minority. 

I‚Äôm sure it will be nuanced and compassionate."
Where‚Äôs the parade and photoshoot?
The mayor NYPD in the whole fucking city can go to hell
This is the guy you should have surrounded not Luigi
"So since Luigi is a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù then this guy should be, right?"
This makes me want to leave the city. Scary.
Death penalty‚Ä¶ and he should have to endure the same torture he placed upon that woman. Burn him.
How come Adams didn‚Äôt go look him in the eye?
Surprise surprise another illegal
Too bad NY isn't a death penalty state
Wants to come to the US and live under our constitution‚Ä¶? Great. Death penalty.
I better see 40 swat guys and the mayor walking with this fuckhead the next time he perp walks.
Where are all the people on tactical gear?
"This is such an unfathomable level of psychopathy that I can't help but wonder if it's a psyop of some sort and the perp will enjoy future help. If it's not, he obviously needs to never see the sun again."
But I thought the police didn't investigate murder victims who were poor.
"Did he get charged with terrorism, or is that just for people who kill mass murd...I mean, health insurance CEOs?"
What are the chances he was on one of Abbott's busses since Texas belligerently exasperated immigration issues?
"Free room and board for the rest of his life, going exactly as he planned."
So sad all the illegal immigrants committing crime and being thrust into the spotlight. Definitely helps the conservative media‚Äôs messaging about deportations
Can't imagine how painful it must've been. I hope it was quick.
"Why do people keep calling her homeless. I literally haven't seen this confirmed ANYWHERE, and why would that matter anyways? She was literally just sleeping on the subway"
Notice he didn't get the same perp walk as Luigi Mangione  even though this was by far a more horrific murder.
"And then her legacy that follows: Reddit cracking jokes about the mayor and police escort . . . .

Disgusting."
Of course not. He killed a poor.
"Glad to see this comment in the top. This death is so much more despicable and horrendous than Brian Thomoson‚Äòs death, but the media, politicians and government don‚Äôt give a shit. If it can‚Äòt be weoponized or used to make an example of somebody to benefit the rich and wealthy, then it is of no value. Fucking disgusting."
Didn't see a helicopter either¬†
"The mayor literary said he did it with Luigi because he had a meeting with CEOs and they were all afraid. 

No joke - he admitted to it."
You know what all these buuut the mayor comments reads like? The folks who use the horrific genocide news in Africa posts to say buuuut why not condemn this and only Israel.
And he‚Äôs an illegal immigrant!  It‚Äôs like democrats‚Äô father in law.
Turkish Airlines only comps flights to the killings of oligarchs. Serfs get left on read.
Eric Adam‚Äôs is a coward and a chump
I'm sure he's busy setting up a dedicated 24/7 hotline for homeless people who feel unsafe.
He back at being corrupted
He‚Äôs a master of hiding
"He is in a Tyvek suit, it's a kind of paper. A lot of times, it's when your clothes might have evidence on them, and you don't have anything else"
"He should be in an acrylic jacket/underwear.  Then have an ""accident"" occur and let him burn for awhile then ""save"" him."
Like something out of the City of Gotham.
Realistically what do you even do in that scenario? I think I would just panic and do nothing most likely. Besides call 911.
I‚Äôd condemn the people taking video but I mean what do you want anybody to even do in that case? It‚Äôs sad but there was nothing anybody could do to help anyway
The fact that 2 cops kept walking past and did nothing whilst she was still very much alive riles me and nobody has questioned it.
Wasn't there a cop there that did nothing?
">I accidentally saw a few seconds of the video and it‚Äôs horrifying tbh even in the few seconds I saw there‚Äôs people just like walking past and no urgency from anyone including the person recording to do anything.

One of them is a cop who walks by multiple times."
Can you please think critically and ask yourself what someone trying to put her out would even look like without an extinguisher?
"""That sucks. Anyways"""
Is there a link somewhere?
Yeah that‚Äôs incredibly fucked up that people‚Äôs instinct WOULDNT be to call 911 and find somebody to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù?
Why would anyone want to live in NYC is beyond me.
Didn't someone recently intervene and get prosecuted for it?
"‚ÄúGreatest city on earth‚Äù

I love New York but minding your own business no matter what‚Äôs going on is a brutal reality of self preservation there.

"I saw the video and it was awful but why was the woman just standing there? It looked like she had no urgency either. No stop, drop, and roll. No flailing of arms. Nothing."
And headlines like that help democrats lose elections.
Immediate upvote. It‚Äôs astonishing that some people don‚Äôt recognize this as a pertinent aspect of the story.

Why? For you?
He will be excused for mental illness and live in some mental hospital happily ever after on taxpayers‚Äô dollar.
"Are people pretending they really don't know why?

There were a lot of cops with Luigi because he had a lot of support and they were worried someone would try to rescue him or maybe shoot one of the cops.

The guy who lit the woman on fire doesn't have supporters so they're not worried about outside interference.

It's not a conspiracy"
"The only real tenable argument against the death penalty, that isn't founded in religious or subjective morality, is that it's an irreversible punishment which prevents us from reversing any errors.  And that's a pretty solid argument, we don't need any others.  Our judicial system makes mistakes all the time.  That argument is sufficient, in my view, to categorically prevent the death penalty as an option.

We don't have multiple tiers of burden of proof where life in prison is when you're ""like, mostly sure,"" and the death penalty is when you're ""super duper sure,"" that the person is guilty.  In both cases, it's *beyond reasonable doubt.*  And as mentioned, we make mistakes all the time, and have erroneously executed people numerous times before, so even if we did have multiple tiers, *which we don't,* they clearly don't work to prevent those errors.  

So if you're saying you're in favor of the death penalty but only in select cases like where someone is set on fire, what you're saying is that you reject the one and only tenable and logical argument against the death penalty, without actually trying to address and dispute it rationally, because all you really care about is whether a crime passes your own personal emotional threshold."
"I can believe that some people don't deserve to live, but also believe that our government shouldn't be taking people's lives."
"Some people need to live 300 years in prison, but since we that's impossible, live with no parole will do"
So you‚Äôre against the death penalty except if it‚Äôs for murder? That‚Äôs basically the only thing that it‚Äôs used for in the first place lol. Just admit to yourself that you‚Äôre fine with the death penalty.
">That said, there is an exception to every rule.

And being against the death penalty is an exception to *that* rule. You either are or aren't opposed to the death penalty."
There‚Äôs no terrorism charge because it wasn‚Äôt(or not currently known) done with intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.
"What he did was horrific, but nah the state shouldn't have the power to execute its citizens."
So you‚Äôre ok with the death penalty if it‚Äôs for murder? That‚Äôs virtually the only thing it‚Äôs used for in the first place! You‚Äôre ok with the death penalty. Just admit that to yourself.

"I agree the focus should be on her suffering, but I think the CEO jokes get voted to the top because so many people are tired of a two-tiered justice system that's far more aggressive towards a CEO-shooter than a man who burned a homeless woman to death."
What do you have to add to the conversation besides calling it out?
They‚Äôre telling the gullible this is how they‚Äôll start and yet I know people are going to act so surprised when it‚Äôs their peaceful hardworking neighbors getting dragged out into the street
"I don't think ""being illegally in the US"" adds anything to being homeless and having a substance abuse issue. 

Being illegal doesn't make you more likely to commit a crime. It makes you less likely to do so, as you want to stay under the authorities' radar as much as possible to avoid a deportation process and ruin everything you've achieved over multiple years of your life.

Generally speaking, US-born citizens are more likely to commit offenses, violent and nonviolent, followed by documented migrants, with non-documented migrants coming last. That's what the study below shows:
 https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/unauthorized-immigration-crime-and-recidivism-evidence-texas-0

Talking about non-documented migrants as if they were a source of crime and all sort of ailments makes for one hell of a headline if you want to invoke fear and push certain political agendas. It's sensationalist and commonsensical, as long as you don't think too hard about it.

However, it does not seem to match the data - at least not in the United States.

Edit: by the way, I was once a (documented) migrant in the United States, and my worst fear was doing anything that would make me lose my visa status and with that the right to continue my PhD studies. I wouldn't even attend any type of rally for fear a cop having a bad day could ruin years of my life. The pressure to stay in line is very real."
How do they determine who is homeless. Do they stop you on the streets and check your papers? Is it just because they *look* homeless?
Because there isn't much risk of people trying to bust this guy out.
Because they‚Äôd turn their weapons on him /s
I know you‚Äôre being sarcastic but given the fact this happened in NYC he will probably be given bail and be out on the street tomorrow
Maybe we should stop jailing people for minor offenses and there wouldn't be overcrowding.

"What's interesting is seeing the left wing reddit struggle with the same thing, but essentially in reverse. Soon after it happened, the reddit echo chamber was crying racism, and then they found out they are the same ethnicity, and started grasping at straws."
Same thing when they talk fetuses with down's syndrome being aborted: pretend like they care but only so far as it serves the agenda.
They just decided they cared about homeless people all of a sudden. Didn‚Äôt take them long to converge around a talking point.
They are pretending like no one helped this woman because they think it was injustice to try and hold the other guy killing homeless people responsible.

I think they're pointing out that this person may have already been struggling at the time and that just makes her death even worse."
"> why would that matter anyways


Because it's a reminder that it's dangerous out there for homeless people. Because ignoring homelessness doesn't help end homelessness. Because we're talking about how the perp is homeless and that's going to be used to paint a certain picture that isn't accurate unless you also acknowledge that the victim was homeless too."
It's in the article that she is possibly homeless. And disabled.
Because approximately 0 people with homes in NYC sleep inside of a subway instead of their home
Legacy is overrated. But the people comparing this situation to the other one are doing so to point out the differences in how this is handled. Jokes can be used to get a point across while trying to also trying to digest the fucked up reality.

He didn‚Äôt scare the CEOs.
"> but the media, politicians and government don‚Äôt give a shit.

You're reading an article from the media. The government quickly arrested the suspect and has begun the prosecutorial process. I'm sure plenty of politicians care as the suspect is supposedly an illegal immigrant.  

What is it that you expect here, though? The police to have arrested the suspect quicker? What media coverage do you want? What do you want politicians to do in reaction to this murder?"
"It‚Äôs different because most of the people saying this are people that live in America and maybe even NY, and we are pointing out the difference in treatment by class that our own government is subjecting us to."

I would say that‚Äôs begged than walking past like nothing is happening or alerting people to help or even recording knowing something is wrong.
Cop was there and walked past it repeatedly according to the video I saw. I doubt calling 911 would have done a damn thing.
"At least two cops walked by - they are ""911""  They weren't even in their radios."
"Throw a jacket on her to stop the flames? Throw a waterbottle on her? Most people would do nothing, but that doesn‚Äôt make it okay. There‚Äôs still many who would not have stood by and it‚Äôs unfortunate that none of them were there and instead the witnesses were all cowards."
"There‚Äôs also probably an element of denial

Like something just seems so implausible, so unrealistic, so ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt be happening to me‚Äù, that the brain doesn‚Äôt process that it‚Äôs happening, which leads to a compounding effect because if other people aren‚Äôt reacting then everyone else follows the herd and won‚Äôt react either, if everyone reacts like nothing is happening the odds that you act accordingly and go about your business as normal go up astronomically"

Yes we New Yorkers needed our disgraced mayor to ensure that no one would rescue Luigi or shoot one of the cops
So why was the mayor there?
"I don't think anyone suspected conspiracy, but you make good points as to why Luigi had more guards. I kinda support Luigi and I still acknowledge your pure logic"

"You could also argue that the death penalty is actually more expensive to the taxpayer than life sentences in many cases. Average time on death row is 19 years. Death row is much more expensive to run than other units. Death row trials and appeals are extremely expensive. Several states have stayed executions indefinitely, but still keep the inmates on death row (single man cells, heavily staffed, more complex moves and other procedures.) 

It also can take a huge toll on the victim‚Äôs family as there are numerous appeals that can be granted then reversed, granted then reversed, leading to traumatic ups and downs in the closure process. 

The toll it takes on execution staff can be significant as well, but that starts to merge into your stated argument especially when we find out someone we executed was actually innocent. It‚Äôs more rare nowadays but it certainly happens. Juries aren‚Äôt perfect. Far from it actually."
"Lol? This is no laughing matter.

I am not fine with the death penalty, but believe that what is the ultimate penalty should be reserved for the most grievous crimes.

To state the obvious, not all murders are equal. The manner of some is so revolting that they fit into a special category of their own."
He's not a citizen
Good thing he's not a citizen then. He's an illegal alien who murdered a citizen.
Not to mention it's a gajillion times more expensive to do that

"We have our own homeless and mentally ill that are born here, and there isn't an option to send them elsewhere, so we're all pretty much in agreement that they are ours to deal with. 

When we have mentally ill/homeless that are here illegally, people question why they are here in the first place and all of your rhetoric goes out the window. 

Reminding people that 'illegal immigrants commit less crimes' when a lady was just lit on fire isn't really gonna strike a chord with... pretty much anyone."
"The man was here illegally, got deported, came BACK illegally, and has now lit a homeless woman on fire and killed her. I think their immigration status is something of note."
Are you dumb or something? Anyone in any country illegally has already committed a crime thus 100% of illegall immigrants are criminals its really not complicated.
I‚Äôm sure there is some way to do an investigation to see if someone is homeless. It isn‚Äôt rocket science
Maybe we should just build more larger prisons and keep everyone locked up.
What? I didn‚Äôt see that kind of content at all. What you smoking bro
Not really a struggle. He did a horrible crime he should go to prison for it. Using it to justify a pogrom against over ten million people is insane though. But it‚Äôs how conservatives talk about these situations. If one member of a minority group steps out of line then all members need to be punished exiled or extinguished.

You uh seen the video?"
I don‚Äôt believe they are being critical of police.
"Hold up, let's not act like the Justice system is faultless. Especially with the NYC mayor calling Luigi guilty without due process. What happened to innocent until proven guilty???"
"1) Being found not guilty by way of insanity is incredibly rare. TV and movies make it seem far more common than it really is. It is an absolute last resort, even in cases where it applies. Doing something heinous and then claiming that only an insane person would do something heinous doesn‚Äôt really fly in criminal court. Turns out criminals do a lot of heinous things, and can be pretty cold and detached about it.

2) Even when a defendant is found not guilty by way of insanity they are still committed to a mental health facility with significant security and supervision. In many cases it is functionally the same as being in a prison that just has more of a hospital flavor.

3) Even attempting this legal strategy is exorbitantly expensive, as it requires extensive documentation, expert testimony, and other massive legal bill generators.

Now I would not be surprised if the attorney raised alcohol or other substance use as a part of his case, which is relatively similar to an insanity claim but far more commonly raised as a mitigating factor."
Damn that's so fucked up.
"I heard police showed up and told him to get away so they could handle the situation, and he just walked away lol"
Every comment when I first read about this was that the police would do nothing because she wasn't a CEO.
Pretty sure his life was already hell on earth if he decided to set a random person on fire and watch her burn alive.
"This is a New York prison, not a 3rd world country."
"If you fall into a volcano, you float. You just sit there and roast. One side hotter than the other, For a fraction of a second, until you burst into flames and breath in your own melting body."
You apparently burn all of your nerve endings off on your skin pretty quickly so you wouldn‚Äôt really feel anything except being cold. But mentally knowing you‚Äôre on fire‚Ä¶ yikes.
Good Lord there's a video? Did anyone tell to help her?
People also keep pointing out that she may have been drunk which also shouldn't matter. Absolutely heinous.
Lol if you think housed people don't nod off on the subway.
has the victim been named?
Or maybe the extreme double standard is so jarring it needs to be pointed out.¬†
"I think you missed the point. The reason this is a big story is because Luigi got far more resources from police and media attention than this case got, which further highlights the blatant classism involved here"
I don't think there is any information about the criminal or the victim yet.
"I think you misunderstood the point. Did you stop reading at that sentence? Have you not been watching the news and the attention Luigi has been given? Do we need to parade the guy with a battalion of heavily equipped police officers? This is them showing the normal folk not to mess with the biggies, the people holding the reigns in our society. Psychological intimidation and manipulation. That is why they do not give a shit."
"The average Redditor doesn't really care about the poor woman who burned to a horrific death, though. They just  use her as a prop for political posturing and getting internet points, by repeating the same unfunny jokes and barbs about the CEO-murder. That reminds me: Luigi can't be  the shooter  because he was playing Nintendo with me at the night of, amirite amirite?(upvotes on the left plz)"
"What exactly is the difference in treatment?

A photo op?"
Good point....i guess he cannot do anything while he's doing his hypocrite walk escorting a detainee.  At least he has that alibi.
I think you might be thinking of a turtle suit (also known as an anti suicide vest). Tyvek suits I think are usually just because the clothing they we‚Äôre are arrested in are collected as evidence. I‚Äôm not an expert though.
"Mix of Chicago and NYC. Both cities have that old corruption rot but different aspects of it, especially in regard to organized crime."
"The purpose of calling 911 would be for paramedics, even though they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten there in time :/"
Never said it would have helped. Just that‚Äôs probably what I would have done.
"I think most people are instinctively reluctant to enter a closed space with a fire in it, such as the train car, especially when the arsonist is between you and the person you're trying to help."
Unfortunately the suspect stood there and fanned the flames with a jacket
"For real, it‚Äôs cold af here right now, people have heavy coats on and could have tried their best to smother the flames."
"And if they catch on fire? Or if the guy comes back and pushes you onto her? 

Everyone wants to believe they‚Äôd be the hero but most of us wouldn‚Äôt have done anything either"
Exactly. I could think of so many things before she was engulfed with flames. People are sick smh
And more focused on recording than at least ATTEMPTING to help with a 911 call or seeing if anyone had water or something.
"Of course it wasn‚Äôt blurred on X, the biggest social media cesspool."
"Agreed. I‚Äôm all for immigration, but allowing caravans of people over the border is unacceptable."
Ah yes nobody cares about illegal immigration unless it‚Äôs to distract from a ceo being murdered. L take
"Yeah because those headlines never came out before the UHC CEO got killed, nice job Sherlock!"
18min and going strong!
"Maybe it'll be because you're spreading disinformation?

He was deported for crossing illegally, not murder"
"The argument is not ‚Äúillegal immigrants are more violent/more criminal/more dangerous‚Äù etc., it‚Äôs that ‚Äúthis particular individual who is violent should not have even been in the country in the first place, and should not have geographically been able to murder this woman.‚Äù"
It validates that guy‚Äôs xenophobic worldview
"Only immigrants have the ability to set other people on fire, apparently."
First Nation has entered the chat‚Ä¶.
It absolutely does matter. This man shouldn‚Äôt have been in America to begin with.
PR attempt to make himself look good bc of his current legal issues with helping foreign agents
"it seems like starberry101 was explaining the presence of armed police‚Äînot Eric Adams, which is what you're addressing.¬†


i don't think you've done anything here."
"Their version was he needed security.  
Your version is the mayor wanted to come down on him hard.  
Are they that different?"
"> Why do redditors speak so confidently when they know nothing? 

Because this is Reddit"
You gotta understand political figures rarely speak their full meaning. When they say anything there‚Äôs multiple unstated meanings they choose to not reveal. They‚Äôre not gonna go around telling people they‚Äôre scared of a rescue. No need to speak that into existence or plant the idea that it could be done
Also ask why was the mayor there?
"They don‚Äôt care about this woman, they‚Äôre glad this happened because it gives them more ammo in their war against no one"
"Yeah it seems wild to me that there are so many people on reddit outright supporting a murderer and are shocked that he will face serious charges. Imagine if everyone got the opportunity to kill someone just because they thought their company was evil - that's what not prosecuting the guy would be endorsing. Having a motive for murder doesnt stop it from being murder, not sure why there are so many struggling with that basic fact"
"I think I should have said tenable *and unavoidable,* because I was trying to make a point that's universal to the death penalty as a concept regardless of implementation, and that a person can't argue their way around this issue by simply suggesting X or Y changes.

Obviously we could make the death penalty cheaper or faster, for example.  We could, at least in theory, address the issues you cited, albeit perhaps not in a manner with which you would agree.  

However, no matter how you slice it, there WILL be errors in the judicial system.  If a person favors the death penalty, regardless of circumstances, they have to be willing to argue that they believe it's preferable that more of these errors be irreversible, than fewer."
"Right, so just toss him across the nearest border

The Atlantic, I believe"
"> people question why they are here in the first place and all of your rhetoric goes out the window 

Next time I suggest you actually read the discussion before posting instead of replying to an imaginary discussion that is not taking place. Whether you want to take care of mentally ill migrants or send them back is up to you, but it has nothing to do with my response. 

I responded to the claim that ""people who meet all three overlapping criteria are very likely to be dangerous"" by correctly stating that being an undocumented migrant does not make one more likely to commit a crime, but quite the opposite. 

You also make a cheap appeal to emotion as if the fact that in this incident the perpetrator is an undocumented migrant justifies casting a factually incorrect blanket judgement over hard-working people just trying to get *by. Prejudice and bigotry will not do anything for the victim. Instead, it is just a small follow-up injustice.

And don't worry, I am here to clarify an implied falsehood. I do not mean to strike a chord with people who have no ears to hear. Now go."
You should read the initial comment and my response more carefully next time. That's not what's being discussed here.
We already jail more people per capita than Soviet era gulags.¬†
"Whenever tragedies happen, some people need to invent fake scenarios in which they are the most beloved, morally correct hero who has the biggest brain and the fattest penis."
Ops point is it‚Äôs a bullshit claim regardless of whether Redditors are claiming otherwise
"Not saying that it‚Äôs faultless, it definitely has issues. 

Just saying that how Luigi‚Äôs case is being handled in the courts is fairly normal and it‚Äôs not going extra fast or being pushed through because of the context (which is what a lot of redditors believe)."
"That is not that unusual for a mayor or police chief or whatever to say ""this guy killed this other guy in cold blood."" Luigi is not exceptional in this regard

Innocent until proven guilty is for court. It's a principle of the court process"
It does mean that there is likely a decent chance an insanity defence will work. Now if he can be made sane again is a completely different issue.
And yet they did the minimal amount of work
So just the jails are 3rd world countries?
"You can‚Äôt scare me, I‚Äôve played video games. You just despawn instantly."
Anakin? Is that you?
"There‚Äôs a number of videos, that‚Äôs the worst part. And every video has a bunch of people standing there with their phones out just recording, it‚Äôs so dehumanizing to watch."
There‚Äôs a cop that walked by as she was burning.
"Agreed. Whether she was housed or unhoused, sober or inebriated, this is a horrifying crime. Same logic applies to the attackers immigration status. I don't care if he was undocumented, documented, or natural born citizen. Anyone who does something like this is evil."
"Damn, I didn't realise I'm sometimes homeless, especially on Mondays."
"They haven't identified her yet, unfortunately.  I'm just referring to this:

> The victim appeared to have mobility issues as indicated by a walker found at the scene"
They‚Äôre in the process of identifying her
This case did not need resources from the police as he was caught really fast‚Ä¶. Are you even hearing yourself?
"It's a big story because a woman got lit on fire on the subway.

Also what resources would you want? The guy got caught almost right away."
"Quite a bit of information actually. Suspect is a homeless Guatemalan immigrant who is suspected of having a substance abuse problem and has also been deported and reentered illegally again. Victim is a disabled woman, a walker was found next to her, who is thought to have been homeless as well. It‚Äôs actually all in the article you are commenting on"
Or it's because people like you who idolize Luigi make him dangerous. He could be killed or someone could attack the cops bringing him in.
"I know what those are. You are correct. There are actually quite a few variations of the suicide safety smock. The paper suits are usually given in place of a uniform when out of the cell (see the medical staff, go to court, ETC.) My agency doesn‚Äôt use them. However, I have done transports to other agencies and received inmates from others facilities in these paper suits."
"The arsonist was not there the entire time. He left the car and watched. And yes, as I stated, I agree most people wouldn‚Äôt do anything. But many would."
"He did, until he walked away and watched, at which point others should have intervened and tried to smother the flames."
Why nobody was viciously beating the shit out of him at that point (notwithstanding the lack of urgency on any passerby to extinguish the woman while she was still alive and suffering) is an indictment on the cop along with everyone else there.
Maybe someone can put him in a choke hold.
I literally said most people wouldn‚Äôt have done anything. But many would. And people intervening would be less likely to catch on fire because they wouldn‚Äôt be asleep like the victim was.
"See how simple that is? Why can‚Äôt our government get the shit together. We either get open borders with the facade of security, or straight up xenophobic policy.¬†"
You're implying the only time the oligarch class has wanted you distracted was when a CEO was murdered?
"Wow, when you simplify an argument past all possible original intent, you can make anyone sound like a dum dum! Are you enjoying the 6th grade?"
"How is it misinformation? It‚Äôs 100 percent true, he‚Äôs a previously deported illegal migrant. The headline says nothing about murder"
So he was previously deported? Just like the headline says?
What exactly is incorrect about my comment?
"either way, the intended result is less illegal immigration. So no need to get into semantics; just put your xenophobic foot forward and argue that stance with your chest. Don‚Äôt pay attention to similar senseless acts that have been committed by people of all walks of life. Talk your xenophobic talk instead."
He wouldn't have been able to set her on fire if he was on the other side of the border. And she'd still be alive. Why do you value her life so little?
"I suppose. What about all of the people we depend on for goods and services that ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt be here‚Äù that commit no other crime?

I bet you benefit A LOT from those people."
Native Americans: o Rly?
"Having extra security is not the same as sending a message, no."
"The point being made is that the mayor doesn't care about coming down on this scumbag, only the guy who murdered a ceo."
"It's not just *thinking* the company is evil. Brian Thompson was the decider for multiple fucked-up choices the company consciously made, including implementing auto-denials by an ""AI"" with a 90% error rate, while increasing UH's *profits* by 25% in just two years (from $12,000,000,000 in 2021 to $16,000,000,000 in 2023.) Quite literally thousands of humans have died for profit, directly because of him, and for his enrichment."
You are the definition of an insufferable twat.
Idk why you're getting down voted. You presented your argument pretty clearly and backed it up with evidence...
And yet more individual persons with much longer sentences are needed.
People in general do not understand the court process. There‚Äôs plenty of hearings before a jury is even selected and a trial date is set.
Agreed that's the timeline itself it's pretty average (I have no idea tbh and I'll admit it) but the whole parading him around like bro is Bane doesn't help group sentiment.
Ok then where is he on this picture? Or where are the 30 cops? You're an hypocrites.¬†
At that point what could you do that could possibly help?
"Two cops walked by, and did nothing."
Yes and I'm not trying to be racist or anything when I say this - but even just looking at the dudes pics he looks fucking evil. He has that look in his eye. Maybe it's my ESP. Idk
"Yea, but that's just bare-bones info. We don't know anything about the people's lives besides the guy being a Guatemalan immigrant and obviously on drugs and the lady being homeless and having a walker."
"Are you by any chance a higher up at a pharmaceutical company, or did you go to one of those US schools where they‚Äôve banned all the educational books? You‚Äòre making a bold assumption that I idolize him, because I don‚Äòt. I can see however, how he represents the anger and frustration of millions of people, who are being ripped off by big corporations or denied the help they should be getting. And how is he any more dangerous than somebody else in handcuffs? If the cops were scared of being attacked while bringing him in, why put him in such public display?  Usually it‚Äôs innocent until proven guilty. In Luigi‚Äòs case, it is guilty until proven innocent. That is not how you start a fair trial."
Hell yes Bruce Rivers Criminal Attorney taught me well.
Yeah just terrible all around
I guess they didn't want to be charged with manslaughter
Because he might be armed and it was a risk that wouldn't amount to anything. He wasn't even trying to escape anyway. Might as well wait for law enforcement to come do their jobs instead of risking adding yourself to the victim count.
"What percentage of people are going to read that and realize he was apprehended at the border and kicked out, then probably crossed again the very next week - vs ppl that read that and assume he was a convicted of a crime like assault or murder and just able to comw right back?"
"Ah yes, bc headlines are just supposed to be technically true.

Definitely no one is reading just the headline. Certainly no one would use that as the entire citation."
Your comment is correct but the headlines are the issue. It's also an issue that we have plenty of psychotic people in our own country that would do the same thing. The fact that he was an illegal immigrant really doesn't hold a lot of status when it comes to this
"Ah, good old, technically it's not untrue. It's just that everyone reading it is going to come away with a factually inaccurate idea - but that's not my problem.

What percentage of people reading your comment are gonna think he got deported for a real crime and not being apprehended by border security? Over 50%?"
"Ok! ¬†Here we go!

I love other cultures, love what people from all cultures and all walks of life have to offer and bring the US! I love the different experiences, perspectives and cultural aspects they bring with them!

I am always kinda weirded out when people view illegal immigration as the exact same thing as legal immigration. You believe they‚Äôre functionally identical, correct?

Further, do you not believe in borders, and feel all people should be able to enter any country they wish an immediately be given full rights, tax benefits, etc., of any country they physically land in?"
Or let‚Äôs just support a system that allows us to vet and screen immigrants properly rather than saying ‚Äúeh fuck it let them come because the old system is too slow anyways‚Äù. There are other countries we constantly love to say ‚Äúsee! They‚Äôre so much better than us for doing this!‚Äù But are so much more strict with immigration. Don‚Äôt forget that.
‚ÄúWith your chest‚Äù lmaoooo.
That's a toddler's understanding of how the world works.
"Yes. I'm pretty sure native Americans aren't fans of their ancestors having been conquered and systematically killed over centuries, and would have preferred that to not have happened, and their ancestors would have tried very hard to stop it, if they had the capability to do so, like the modern US has."
"Every number you have put here is either misleading or an outright lie lol. First, it lacks any context to list total profits, you want to look at profit margins. AKA profit as a % of revenue. [United‚Äôs is steady at or below 6%](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UNH/unitedhealth-group/profit-margins). This is partly because insurers are regulated and have to pay 85% of customer premiums to cover claims and for quality improvement. You can look up [Apple](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/net-profit-margin) or [Pepsico](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PEP/pepsico/net-profit-margin) or pretty much any non-insurance company and see that private insurance is not as lucrative as other businesses. 

For the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, it was just an algorithm that people are calling AI to sound scary, and it was for a very specific claim process of patients on Medicare advantage seeking rehab. And the 90% comes from the *patients who appealed when their claim was denied and had it overturned*. Citing that 90% as the ‚Äúerror rate‚Äù is a flat out lie. If it denied 1 million claims, and 9,999,990 of them were uncontested, but then those last 10 were contested and 9 overturned, would that be a 90% error rate? Obviously not. There‚Äôs selection bias in who chooses to contest their claims, it‚Äôs people who have a case to. 

This nuance is lost on the Reddit revolutionaries though, so it‚Äôs easier to just recite the made up stats and worship a murderer from the sidelines"

"If the photo is such a big deal ... Luigi's attorneys will bring that up in court. They will say, ""the coverage makes it hard for my client to get a fair trial in NYC.""

I don't know you at all so I'll withhold judgment either way, but it is very common for someone to say that right before they say something racist.  It's your call.  Just didn't want people to assume the worst if it could be helped.   Peace"
"probably because it's not as easy to find information on them as a child of millionaires, go figure."
One that I have been told about but not have seen in practice: It‚Äôs basically a suicide safety blanket and they basically roll them up into an inmate burrito with Velcro straps. They only do that though when the inmate is continuously harming/attempting to harm themselves over and over again.
This makes no sense since someone was found innocent for attacking someone who hadn‚Äôt actually done anything to anyone and was praised by the president and met him.I don‚Äôt get why people are acting like that scenario went badly for him.
"So in other words, no misinformation anywhere in their comment. Thanks!"
"Because if you get convicted of murder you don‚Äôt get deported..? 

A 100 percent factual headline is misinformation to you because someone might assume something lol incredible hoop jumping"
Does that matter? Either way it's a failure of policy
Sounds like you have your own personal biases that you are applying as a universal fact. Which it‚Äôs not.
That's literally how it works. Him not being around to set her on fire = her not burning to death.
"I'm not even gonna get into the rest of what you said. UHG's revunue last year was $371,000,000,000. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176624000023/a2023q4exhibit991.htm)

Actually, no, I will get into it. Auto-denial should not be a thing at *all* when it comes to health coverage. A person needing immediate healthcare should not *have* to take the time to appeal a denial of the health coverage that they have. What about the people who couldn't fucking appeal?"
"I agree, mass incarceration is not the solution, but we are not getting anywhere near fixing the cause.  

Until society agrees on a solution for the problem, lock them up, keep them separated from society for long periods of time.

Mass incarceration is expensive, but it it‚Äôs very effective.

The important things in life are costly"
"I think their point is that the mayor or officer gave a responsibility to not pass public judgement, as they know how much those kind of statements impact public sentiment. And the statement that doing so is common is false. It happens, but it‚Äôs well understood to be inappropriate and quite a large mistake."
Yeah I think that‚Äôs the one I called a turtle suit.
"Yup, just post the most sensationalist thing that is technically true. Who gives a damm if people leave thinking something that is untrue, that's their problem."
">A 100 percent factual headline is misinformation to you because someone might assume something lol incredible hoop jumping

Ofc, you can say something that is true but misleading, thus disinformation. Is that not obvious? Or are you gonna nitpick on the word mis/disinfo, when i clearly said disinfo at first?

And I hate to break it to you, but assumptions are a fundamental part of language. You just don't notice most of them."
"It's an incredibly different problem, though.

One being allowing violent criminals into the country.

And the other, it's pretty easy to overstay a visa or pay a criminal to smuggle you across the southern border.

God forbid you identify the actual problem, instead of saying the broad thing that will allow anyone to think this supports their narrative."
"What point are you trying to make giving me their *revenues*. Do you understand what revenue is and how it differs from profit? You just listed 16 billion in profit for 2023 in your other comment. And now that their revenue is 371 billion. That means that their profit margin would be 4.3%. Put differently, you‚Äôre telling me that they spent $355,000,000 on claims and administrative cost ($315b of which has to go to patients by federal law). Is this supposed to be damning evidence that we have no choice but to cheer on lunatics killing people in the street?

You did a good job not getting into the rest of what I said by addressing nothing I actually said, and instead providing *another* falsehood. The program was not an ‚Äúauto-denial‚Äù, it helped inform actual people making decisions about the care that patients need. 

All of this is to say that I think we would be better off with an NHS style system than relying on private insurance markets because businesses shouldn‚Äôt be making these decisions. But people spreading lies to justify executions in the street are just embarrassing and delusional, and certainly not helping whatever cause they think they‚Äôre promoting"
"They may have that point, but that point doesn't match up to reality. I have seen similar statements for people not named Luigi Mangione. It's just they don't know that, so they think this is the first time

I think people want to turn this guy, Luigi, into a hero, and a martyr. He's neither one. What's happening to him, is not that unusual."
"There is literally nothing in that headline to make people think what you did, it's entirely your error."
"True! It's called reading comprehension. If someone fails at that, it's likely their fault!"
"It‚Äôs not misleading in the slightest bit. Again, you don‚Äôt get deported for murder. Most of the population knows that and wouldn‚Äôt assume that, you‚Äôre one of the few ignorant"
"You framed your response as what it looks like to the public, so as far as optics go the minutiae doesn't matter - they will see it as a failure of policy"
">And the 90% comes from the *patients who appealed when their claim was denied and had it overturned* 

>The program was not an ‚Äúauto-denial‚Äù, it helped inform actual people making decisions about the care that patients need. 

So which one is it? Are patients being denied, and having to appeal to be approved? Or are they being helpfully informed so their caregivers can give them the help that they need?"
"I mean it definitely is the reality, public officials do have a responsibility not to spread misinformation‚Ä¶ and the fact that it happens doesn‚Äôt change that‚Ä¶ are you good? This seems like it‚Äôs really getting under your skin, maybe it‚Äôs time to step away from the internet for a few weeks?"
And every failure of policy is the same? That's ridiculous.
"> to the public, so as far as optics go the minutiae doesn't matter - they will see it as a failure of policy

Headlines like that are how people get elected saying ""they're letting criminals walk free."" One policy failure is not equal to another, even for the public."
"they will have to have the last word, and it will slowly warp into topic changing/goalpost moving.  this person is not capable of introspection or accountability, it will go on forever most likely."
"Claims are sometimes denied by an insurance company that needs to determine when they need to pay for patient care. That‚Äôs how insurance works. It is not an automated program to deny claims, as you suggested. It was basically a virtual assistant. All of this is easily googleable on your own, but I will say I appreciate that you aren‚Äôt harkening on the false 90% figure and shifting the goalposts instead, so that‚Äôs an improvement"
"They're not spreading misinformation, is my point. They are saying, ""we have caught the suspect in the shooting. We believe he waited for him and killed him.""

That's not misinformation, unless you know some secret. That's saying the information they have. It bothers me, because you don't know what you're talking about"
Luckily there isn‚Äôt much happening today
"At the gate here in MSN, gate agent says ground stop could delay our flight (as well as other AA flights) up to 90 minutes, but to be confirmed. All other connecting flights out of AA hubs (e.g. Charlotte, Chicago) will be similarly delayed she says. Everyone here is super chill about it though; what else can you do I suppose.

Update: Ground stop apparently lifted, we're boarding very soon now according to the gate agent. Overall maybe a 45-60 minute delay, definitely not the worst I've ever experienced."

So for them to cancel ALL flights means there‚Äôs some fundamental procedure wrong with the airline - such as automated flight planning or some maintenance method.    Doesn‚Äôt sound like a quick fix."
Sips tea from my recliner
It was Boeing to happen eventually
American Airlines in San Antonio are still boarding and still taking off
Whew! Just turn it off and on again
"Boarded here in Little Rock. About a 90 minute delay for me. Sounds like the issues are resolved, but the downstream effects will be rough today for those with connections."
"This is the start to a Netflix movie, right?"
Nice of them to be so specific with us.
Is this another one of crowdstrike update?
Have you guys seen this movie - Carry on?
"Look, we saw the movie Carry On. Just let the terrorists get on the plane with their bomb and defuse it mid-flight....it's the only way. Quit inconveniencing everyone else."
"To add to the hubbub‚Ä¶ our Champaign (IL) to Dallas/FW flight (connecting to San Diego)got diverted to Midland (TX) due to storms at D/FW that has shut down all operations‚Ä¶ until‚Ä¶ who knows.

We need to refuel but five other American Eagle planes are parked around us‚Ä¶ some fun‚Ä¶

We got to the airport and we‚Äôre all set to board when the stoppage began. They had to deboard the plane ahead of ours, at the gate, then re-board them and clear the gate and bring in our plane‚Ä¶ once we‚Äôre loaded they backed away from the gate and sat us on the taxiway for 50-minutes‚Ä¶.

Heading toward DFW they first told us we were on a slow down due to storms plus the delay and went from delay into DFW, then being diverted to Amarillo‚Ä¶ then being diverted here to Midland‚Ä¶. What fun‚Ä¶"
Glad I flew yesterday.
just think their are infinite versions of planes trains and automobiles happening as we speak .
How fun for my mother and father traveling traveling last minute halfway across the country after my uncle's sudden death...it's also her birthday...they also got grounded after diverting around storms in Dallas. Merry Christmas!
Have they tried power cycling it?
"Just landed in Dallas from Birmingham, started at 8:15AM, touched down at 4:20PM. Was grounded in Houston for hours and was told we‚Äôd be prioritized when we landed in Dallas, only to land and find out there are NINE planes that are in front of us for the gate. Apparently it‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst come, first serve‚Äù and the whole being prioritized was BS. I we‚Äôve missed our connection flight and I‚Äôm just exhausted wanting to get out of this plane!"
This will bring joy to millions who now have an excuse not to spend Christmas at their mother-in-laws‚Äô.
"I didn‚Äôt need another reason to avoid American Airlines, but thanks for the heads up!"
My heart goes to all the employees right now.
We bailed these companies out
"American Airlines is the worst airline 

I bailed on them for Delta 2 years ago, been smooth sailing since"
AA gets worse every year. Canceled my rewards card with them and stopped flying them whenever possible.¬†
American may be the worst of the worst. I really miss Continental.
"Julie Rath, the SVP of technology, was on the news last month showing off their enhanced boarding process. Literally everyone they showed was using paper boarding passes and the agents were still struggling. üòÜ

Every time they roll something out they end up breaking five other things. This company can‚Äôt keep up with technology at all. They need fresh leadership across the board. Not just replacing DUI Doug."
American Airlines - Let shit not take flight!
"Sensationalized title that doesn't match the article title: 

# ""American Airlines resumes flights after nationwide 'technical issue'"""
"On the eve of Christmas when all seemed lost, one man decided, *narrows eyes* ""Not today."""
My sister is about to board an AA flight out of Philadelphia and it‚Äôs only delayed 15 mins. Doesn‚Äôt sound like this is that big of a deal.
"I'm imagining like how it is in movies, where there's a giant red button that somehow shuts the entire operation down, and some dude at AA leaned against the control panel and accidently pushed it with his elbow."
News said the issue is resolved and just residual delays now. Merry Christmas Eve!
Die Hard 2. Better call in the Army to help.
"Glad I'm on Delta today, American is my primary airline."
Merry Christmas to all the employees.
Perfect timing given it's the day before Christmas.
Can we start betting which airline is going to have a problem over the holidays?  Seems like an annual thing now.
Probably Kopek notifying the authorities of that novichok gas.
That sucks for last minute Xmas travelers
"<monty python>
I got better
/s
(It is fixed now according to Reuters)"
Im seriously surprised this airline still exists.  They are up there with Spirit & Frontier as the shittiest.
My brother was suppose to take off at 6:55.  They are still on the tarmac.
Did anyone report a man with a Glock 7?
"Well, this is certainly worse than the time last month where the plane was 45 minutes late getting to the gate because they forgot it was over in maintenance and hadn't requested it be brought to the gate.

Good times...."
"Everyone laughs they I fly spirit. Know who hasn't had a holiday meltdown, computer update or ""glitch?"" Yep. Spirit. I've flown a lot all over the US and had the fewest delays and screw ups with Spirit (and least damaged luggage surprisingly)."
"And the plot to home alone is... Cancelled flight, nothing interesting happend."
"They outsourced to India, who outsourced to Vietnam, who outsourced to Bangladesh, who outsourced to two guys in a garage in Idaho."
All this and throw in the fact that Dallas is getting rocked by storms. Glad I don't need to fly anywhere.
You just got Southwest'd.
‚ÄúWe give up on this Christmas shit‚Äù
What was actual issue?!
"I‚Äôll be taking an international trip next month on AA. Fortunately, I work in tech support!"
I just finished ‚Äòcarry on‚Äô on Netflix. I know how this unfolded.
Southwest don‚Äôt give a fuck.  I‚Äôm watching from my balcony
Hmm. Simpsons predicted a nationwide internet outage on Christmas. Let‚Äôs see if they‚Äôre right.
Airlines are a complete joke these days.
This is actually the start of whacky romcom.
Yeah their birthday isn't until tomorrow
I dropped my wife off at the airport just minutes before this happened... she's in the air now.
"Probably a promotional stunt for that new movie, Carry On. Or Diehard: in an Airport."
You would think one would prepare a contingency plan since it's a important event that occurs annually... guess redundancy isn't profitable
"I mean the aliens are flying around in US airspace, but other than that, nah not much happening."
Very slow travel day thank god.
Everybody learned from Southwest fucking the goat
"Ah yes, Epic employee going home on Christmas Eve."
Thanks for sharing your in-real-time experience. I've had worst delays more much more minor things!
"This happened to me once. Yes every flight will be delayed so you won't miss your next flight.      
Sorry for the inconvenience hopefully doesn't last long."
Looks kinda paltry compared to Delta‚Äôs 4 day meltdown a few months ago.
"I've seen MSN be super chill for delays, almost always. Not sure if it's the chill atmosphere of the smaller airport, lesser crowd, or if it's the spotted cow."
"And then another 90 mins when the previous 90 is up, and continue forever"
MSN is probably my favorite airport
"Glad it wasn't any longer than that, especially with it being Christmas Eve.  Save travels."
"I boarded a flight at LGA at 5:30 for 6 am take off. We pulled away from the gate then sat for about an hour before we returned to the gate. An hour later we are told to get off the plane. Maybe 20 minutes later, we get back on the plane. We wait around 30 minutes for them to de-ice the plane, and another 30 to pull away. We sat a while and just pulled back to the gate around 10 and have been told nothing in the 20 minutes of sitting here."
I was told my connecting flight would be delayed by alaska air when they shut down the seattle airport. It turned out they started launching shit asap when the airport reopened.
"> Everyone here is super chill about it though

Oh good. Given the date and the issue, I was expecting nationwide attempts to unlock the secret fleet of airplanes that only open if you're mean enough to the airport employees."
Let us know when you land safe.
Anybody that's traveling on Christmas eve better be a grizzled vet that isn't going to be ohased by something like this.
"Currently on my 3rd delay from AUS>DFW. Depart was originally 10a, now looking at 12:15p. Fingers crossed."
Seems like they tried turning it off and turning it on again.
The delay didn't change a thing for flights after sunrise. The customer service line was like a half mile long. I missed my connection flight and they rebooked me for another flight 5 hours out from my original. American airlines doesnt give a fuck.
"Bruh I flew AA today, left at 5 AM EST and they were rushing us into the plane. Sounds like it was hitting the fan in real time"
"As someone who binged all airline investigations I can find on YouTube, a 90 min ground delay is better than a crashed plane"
60 minutes? That‚Äôs just the average Wednesday for them.
"Lucky.  My BUF>CLT flight got delayed and we missed our connecting flight to STT.  Showing up in St Thomas about 26h later than planned and I'm on about 4h of sleep since Monday.  

Thanks American.  Merry fuckin Christmas.  


Edit: I will say this.  The AA staff has been absolutely lovely despite how some folks were treating them.  This sucks, but AA staff were MVPs."
And then immediately set their out of office message.
"I bet it's the same thing it was the past x times this happened before.

Outdated APIs with outdated route management not accounting for pilots not being able to fly 24/7, not having good compatibility with other airlines and not accounting for nearby airports. They've needed an overhaul and a new industry standard for the past 40 years."
This minor change won't hurt anything... No one will notice!
"I bet it's the same thing it was the past x times this happened before.

"Don't techs know the mantra ""read only Friday?"" Don't touch anything before a holiday."
The one who whose manager made them work on christmas eve
Relatable: our CTO migrated the live DB of our SaaS solution to a new DB last Friday and immediately went on holidays. Everybody around is quite unfamiliar with the new solution. What can possibly go wrong?
Its obviously the New Jersey ufos duh
Seems like a recurring theme
Obviously the pimply faced youth.
Boss move to push to prod today. I hope it was also the last day of their two-week notice.
"Seriously,  though.  I cannot imagine their cm policy allowed changes this close to christmas."
Play polka in a box truck of course
You‚Äôve seriously never heard of the Kenosha Kickers?!
Where are the upvotes? DO THESE KIDS NOT KNOW JOHN CANDY?
Take a train.

"As I deal with the frustrations today,  I'm going to use this mantra! Thanks, kind internet stranger, Septopuss7."
Just watched this the other day
"Of course. Travel, especially involving airports, always brings out the best in people. This is especially true during the holidays"
"Had a 5am flight..

Had to deboard the plane 30mins later. 

It's now 2 hours later and we are boarding... slowly.."
"It'll probably go something like:

Car Rental Agent: [cheerfully] Welcome to Marathon, may I help you?

Yes.

Car Rental Agent: How may I help you?

You can start by wiping that fucking dumb-ass smile off your rosy fucking cheeks! Then you can give me a fucking automobile! A fucking Datsun, a fucking Toyota, a fucking Mustang, a fucking Buick! Four fucking wheels and a seat!

Car Rental Agent: I really don't care for the way you're speaking to me.

And I really don't care for the way your company left me in the middle of fucking nowhere with fucking keys to a fucking car that isn't fucking there. And I really didn't care to fucking walk down a fucking highway and across a fucking runway to get back here to have you smile in my fucking face. I want a fucking car... right... fucking... now.

[pause]

Car Rental Agent: May I see your rental agreement?
 
I threw it away.

Car Rental Agent: Oh, boy.

Oh, boy, what?

Car Rental Agent: [narrows her eyes]  You're fucked."
"Well on one hand, it's Christmas Eve.

On the other, if you're flying American Airlines, you're used to cancelled flights already."
I'm sure there won't be any travelers beansquabbling the American Airlines representatives as they damn them.
"Yup. They're about to have Kevin's Mom from ""Home Alone"" screaming at them all day.

Folks, if you are personally affected by this, remember that NOBODY at American who has direct contact with customers caused this or has the power to fix it. 

A little kindness and empathy will go a long way."
Yep.. I can't imagine what they're dealing with
Everything is back up now! Only delayed 45 minutes
"Oh boy, I just started working at the airport a couple weeks ago. Not a very customer facing position (maintenance) but I still do interact with folks. Hopefully it gets resolved quickly"
Yeah the ones who drew the short straw today. I don't miss the service industry at all.
"I was flying home from a work trip on that day this summer that like... everything went down, hotels, flights, car rentals. I wanted to just give them all a hug (but not really they wouldn't like that lol). I was very lucky and got home like 2 hours after I was supposed to. I like to think it was good karma."
"I'm imagining due to lack of planes, people such as grumpy man and a shower curtain merchant, will have to that trains and automobiles"
"Wow, you won the lottery today!"
Buy a lottery ticket
Yeah I landed earlier today
Good for you
"I'm glad I flew on Saturday!  Although my flight was delayed an hour on Saturday... but not American's fault... someone decided to get sick on runway at the last second.  Had to turn around and go back to the terminal, wait for EMS, refuel, and then take off.

According to the article, this delay was only about an hour too.  Not a huge deal."
"Personally id rather stay landed while there are ""technical issues"""
"Lotta people getting added to the No Fly List this year. Add in drone hysteria, the war(s), and the general low level chaos of an average GTA online server and you've got Christmas '24 in a nutshell!"
The system for baggage weight calculations supposedly.
Could be a Russian nerve agent smuggled onto an airplane through a complicated series of hostage taking and coercion. I just hope there's a TSA agent with aspirations for the LAPD to stop it.
"General Esperanza is being extradicted from Honduras, the plane arrives today."
"Was on a AA flight this morning waiting to take off when they announced it. They told us it was flight planning software crashing so they couldn‚Äôt plot the route to our destination, not a baggage weight issue."
"You break the maintenance server. As in the one that tracks the maintenance. If that system is not available, the whole fleet has be grounded until it's up again. 

That's just the one I know of personally, and my data's over 20 years old, but it was with AA (Sabre at that point)."
Some sort of massive back end IT issue. Hopefully more details will come out.
I was hoping someone would make this joke!
It's too similar. All flights grounded on Xmas eve?
Netflix promo is crazy
"We can continue hate for absurd CEO compensation - but this is a situation that ain't that. 

Flight should ALWAYS be grounded when safety of passengers are at risk. Also, because they fixed it within an hour on a holiday do you think the CEO deserves a bigger bonus? Probably not.

Let's critisize and praise them when proper, not let our voices get lost in insane babble."
That movie was a bomb. I blame Jason Bateman for that too.
Super classic. I hope Chicago is not shoveling snow!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday
Knockon delays from it are still being felt
"It‚Äôs not, every airline has flight schedules reduced for today, there‚Äôs actually more flights running tomorrow on Xmas day than Xmas eve."
"Nah, there's like a 99% chance it's more benign than that."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor applies here

""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."""
My mind jumped to something similar but it seems to be resolved now.
The 90‚Äôs? That‚Äôs generous ü§£ SABER was developed in the 60‚Äôs
It was a quick fix
Destiny is a mother Fokker.
Honestly I've never really had any issues with AA (until today). United is EXPONENTIALLY worse.
Used to have to fly them all the time due to the DFW hub. Since moving I‚Äôve never looked back. Shame too because I thought they were one of the better ones 10+ years ago
At least of the legacies they absolutely are. There operations side of things is absolute trash
the article title was most likely changed after the issue was resolved
It‚Äôs a much bigger deal for those catching very early flights in the Southwest/west coast.
"We flew back in from Jamaica in March on AA. 
It was 11pm at night, clear weather ( there had been a storm the day before) 
They told us at midnight our flight was cancelled and it would be two days before they could reschedule. 
There were no hotels available because of two huge things going on and the only one left was $3000 a night. 
Thousands of people were sleeping on the floor of the Miami airport with children and the airlines would not even give out bottled water to parents with kids. Water was $2.50 in the machines, restaurants were closed overnight. 
Mothers were crying in the bathroom stalls because they were stranded for days without extra money for a room. Scared of sleeping and not feeling safe they were sleeping in the handicap stalls. 
The thing is, people were mean to the airline personnel, they were horrible and got treated the way they treated people. 
People were not mean to each other though. 
People who had reserved rooms ahead of time shared so people could at least rest. 

One lady found several rooms and a ride to a different town, Orlando maybe‚Ä¶.and she used her credit card to pay for food for several families. Every single person she helped sent her money back. It was one of the stories I found comforting. 

Anyway, come to find out‚Ä¶. All the planes were on the ground at Miami. The huge back up was ‚Ä¶..DIDDY‚Äôs plane was being searched. 
They of course blamed weather. They don‚Äôt have to provide food vouchers and lodgings if the cancellation is weather related. 

I decided that was my last flight on American. Travel insurance paid us back the extra $1500.00 it cost to drive home. I am so thankful that we had it. We have a credit card for travel and we had booked our trip with that card. 

The airline reimbursed the last leg of our trip, in October‚Ä¶. SEVEN MONTHS LATER.

I hope these people that are stranded are helped out and treated better than the thousands stranded when we were. I have never seen employees be so hateful to people they failed."
"Netflix did just release a romcom that started due to a delay flight. It‚Äôs called, ‚ÄúSee you next Christmas‚Äù

Edit: it‚Äôs actually called ‚ÄúMeet me next Christmas‚Äù"
"> whacky romcom.

Wacky romcom - fun times

Whacky romcom - horror thriller"
"Very, very interesting idea.  Care to elaborate on how the story plays out?"
Thinking more Home Alone 5 (or is it 6?)
"AA giving us all the meetcute we all need. 

Either that or the travel stress will cause many to rethink their relationships with loved ones."
It's not even their birthday. Just the day chosen to celebrate it.
"(Most) Christians these days  love the birth and the death of Christ.  It‚Äôs the middle part, where he hung out with the poors and the sick, that they (conveniently) forget."
Nailed it.
You mean the guy from that weird book?
That's one hell of a drop.
Don‚Äôt you mean: Die Hard 2
"Ahh yes, the one where Jason Bateman's face looks like an equilateral triangle."
I actually really enjoyed this movie
Poor goat
Who would‚Äôve thought that A Commodore 64 and a single Rolodex would continues its reign of superiority.
"The... what? Is this an expression I'm not familiar with or does goat represent something?

Edit: I know ""greatest of all time"" but that doesn't make sense to me here either, unless Southwest has some stellar reputation I wasn't aware of"
"Ahh, yes‚Ä¶ the Christmas night I spent in the airport in Chicago on my way to Boston. Southwest sucked that day. Our pilot did manage to get us out like 8 hours late, I‚Äôm pretty sure we were the only SW flight that made it out of Chicago that night."
"Southwest's strategy of ""Can't have new software problems if you only run old hardware?"""
Haha I was thinking they laid someone off who they shouldn‚Äôt have
was it the backpack that gave it away
I'm the only one working in my office (well from home)  I'm really hoping nothing breaks today and I have to call the IT director.
It was a mom who had to get home because she realized she forgot her child
"The concerning part will be crew issues later tonight. If AA is running a higher than normal flight schedule, they‚Äôre going to be putting out fires all day and possibly into tomorrow."
Well you would hope but the AA customer service line is pretty long right now due to missed connections.
"I stopped flying Delta when they had that big IT outage back in 2016 or 2017 or so. I was stranded overnight in an airport, just wandering the halls and trying to find anything I could sleep on. I had nothing to drink or eat as by the time my flight was cancelled all of the shops were closed. By the time my flight started boarding in the morning I had one of the worst headaches I've ever had.

Delta offered me a $200 voucher, for tickets with Delta, to be used in the next 12 months - That was their compensation to me. Now I won't ever fly with them again."
Were the Two Women at the gate staring at Fat Squirrels outside the window while you waited?
"Ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word!"
"I'm sure they put it through change management where some entry level analyst that started a month ago said ""seems reasonable"" and approved the code promotion."
I'm sure by the time an overhaul is completed it will be outdated and need to be overhauled again
But if they did that the poor C suite wouldn‚Äôt get their monthly raises! Think of the C suite this Christmas!
"The problem is there‚Äôs way too much red tape in changing anything, way too much legacy crap, and no one wants to pay what it would actually cost to do this."
"FOS and its programs like DECS and RES are incredibly robust for their age, they‚Äôre just spectacularly old. People gave Southwest hell for their old systems that were developed or purchased off the shelf in the 90s while FOS was developed in the late 60s. For all their faults, AA was normally pretty willing to dump money into FOS to keep it running well.

American, among almost every Major carrier, is undergoing a modernization where all the employee facing systems are being changed over to something modern, but the backbone of their operation is still FOS/DECS/RES. This will be true until a newer backbone system can be developed once all the other new employee facing systems are in place. On the Flight Keys side (partial DECS replacement), they‚Äôre about 7-8 years deep into the switch over."
"They probably have the same fucking system for all their maintenance that they had twenty years ago. You were never to touch it in case it broke because the whole fleet would get grounded. Every time I see a fleetwide stop I laugh and wonder if they've ever replaced that damn system.  But AA became Sabre became EDS became IBM and that's when I got off the fuckin' trolley. Given all that, I'm guessing it's still on the same fucking server. LOL"
Polka? in the midwest? you're not talking about Gus Polinski? Polka king of the Midwest?
"Twin lakes Polka?

The Polka Twist?"
They literally don't.  JC has been dead for a while.
Maybe even an automobile
Oh yes!! I hear the melodic singing of Michael row the boat ashore in unison from the stranded passengers as we speak!!
And for some reason flying freight has gone from being a mediocre career for a pilot to the upper end of the food chain.  Very strange.
Also where is socially acceptable to drink at any hour of the day.
Great movie

"I finally understand that reference! Watched that movie for the first time a few months ago. I‚Äôm > 35. Ya, ya, I know."
Kevin's mom wasn't too bad. It's gonna be Steve Martin from planes trains and automobiles.
"It really makes a giant difference. We've been bumped off flights, gotten screwed by airlines a few times. Yet I've always gotten what I needed from the gate agents because I've been calm, patient and accepting that they're very limited in what they can do. If there's a bullshit charge they can't do anything about it, contact customer service after your trip. If you need to get on a different flight, they may not be able to accommodate you. Work with them, be flexible and thank them for helping you."
"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been from Chicago to Paris to Dallas to where the hell am I?

"People at the airport I‚Äôm at are all just sitting around chilling. I imagine as the day goes on and people are trying to get places before Christmas, it‚Äôll be horrible."
Dealing with the holiday cheer?
Oh that's good
"Well we are sitting on the tarmac waiting for a gate top open so I may still  e on the plane for a while. And even though we are not at a gate yet, there are people already standing in the aisles, despite the flight attendants telling them to sit down."
"Why? They just used up all their luck!

"Yeah, aircraft being overweight or having an incorrect center of gravity is a huge safety of flight problem"
Uggh. Data actually needed for flight :-(
"But in a turn of events that surprised no one, the separate and completely interdependent computer system for calculating passenger upcharges for baggage weight was functioning flawlessly."
"You know, I never thought about the fact that suitcases probably go on the plane in specific orders to avoid bad weight distribution..."

"Not Die Hard good, but a decent entry to the ""Action Thriller Christmas Movie"" catalogue."
Carry On
"I literally watched that movie other night, the timing is very funny."
I understood this reference
I really enjoyed that movie.
It was the most obvious in my opinion - I just watched it
The IT guys that had to work on Christmas are definitely getting themselves the corporate fuck you pizza party though!
"And then don't forget Clarke's law:

""any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice""."
Glad to hear it.
"Just flew them to and from Mexico. 2 hour equipment delay out of DFW to Mex, then a 3 hour equipment delay in Charlotte on our return. Missed our connecting flight. They put us up in a hotel that was right out of a Wes Craven film and gave us $12 dollar meal voucher useable only at the airport. 12 bucks. Have they ever eaten at an airport?"
Meet Me Next Christmas? Or is it a different but same movie? Haha
"Does it star Lacey Chabert?

Coincidentally lining up with the end of Saturnalia.
Yep had to white wash the pagan holidays
"Well have you seen any decorations that celebrate ‚Äúhanging out with poor and sick people‚Äù? A door wreath? A greeting card? A Starbucks cup? How are we supposed to show the world how virtuous we are without the decorations, presents, greeting cards and swag? Come on!!"
"They like the flipping tables and whip thing also. Makes then feel righteous in their unfounded rage. Jesus chased money changers and people using his temple for profiteering out, and so clearly someone deserves their wrath. Someone who can't fight back."
Die Hard 2: Christmas Boogaloo?
His nose also looks like a gnomes butt in this one. Great addition honestly.
"I didn‚Äôt hate it. It‚Äôs a good sugar adrenal movie. If you like Diehard or Taken, this is a great movie for that. Bateman is really terrifying at times."
"It was fun. It will never replace Die Hard as my favorite Christmas movie, but it scratched an itch I didn't know I had."

It's only the day before a major holiday...
"It's probably long because people calling asking when their flight will be. I'm sure there are some missed connections, but from my past experience I didn't hear of people missing anything."
"I was caught up in the Southwest mess. I realized early that it was going to be a disaster and caught two tickets on another airline to get home a couple hours after my original flight. Southwest refunded my two tickets, paid for my replacement flight, and gave me $600 travel credit. I was pretty content with that."
"[angrily through a cigarette]

"Hey can you review my pull request? Simple change, not much to see."
"Or outsourced part of their IT to a country that doesn't celebrate Christmas, so it's just another day.   I'm pretty sure AA has a tech hub in Hyderabad."
"With corporate-facing software, it's entirely likely that another more modern software currently doesn't exist, and hasn't been created for them in the last 20+ years.

And if they got one made, it would probably be in use for another 20 years.  The lifespan of things like this tends to be pretty high.

Can't speak to airlines, specifically, fwiw.  Maybe they're doing better than most other industries - but this would seem to imply not."
"They‚Äôre currently in the process to move off of FOS to something else, but this current attempt has been underway for about 6-8 years and is the closest they‚Äôve managed to get in the past 30 years."

The very first Meg Griffin!
"Man, Hallmark is way past rational plotlines. I was at the ER last year about this time, and there was a movie that was centered around a Santa-only bar crawl, where the main character hated Christmas. While in a Santa suit, at a Santa-only convention."

"I don't why but that made me laugh out loud in bed. Thank you kind internet stranger for giving me a good laugh, hope you have plenty of delicious food and friendly hugs during the holidays."
The true spirit of Christmas
Seems that romans and christians had the same idea of trying to tie some festivities to the winter solstice. Sol Invictus' birthday doesn't even seem to have been that important of a holiday compared to other festivals in december.
I think they‚Äôre going to be very surprised and unprepared when they find that people are going to fight back.
I've got it!  Let's hate *the immigrants*!
"Yep.  Tonn of plot holes if you want to analyze it, but it's not really that kinda movie.  An enjoyable entry in the ""Action thriller for Christmas"" catalogue."

"I just finished replacing a 25 year old critical system for a large airline. Still worked well but replacement parts are impossible to get.

The new system has a whole host of issues and only a 10 year expected lifetime.

Airlines generally hate change because it introduces risk. They are also way less willing to stomach capital costs than they used to so they make choices in what they do buy that really do not help things. (Looking at you, cloud based everything)"
"The London subway system was one of the first in the world to adopt a fully automated train control system. That software was written in Assembly. It is STILL being used today, 56 years after it got put into use.

The admins showed me it when I worked there decades ago and said ""don't ever touch this, if it breaks the whole fleet gets grounded.""

"Oh dang, I don't envy you. Not because of the green screens, but because of the switch. It will suck. My company existed on COBOL programming and  IBM mainframes with custom built green screens to match. Made a switch to some new software and now everything is 10 times worse and 10 times harder to fix.

ETA: There's something to be said about building things in-house and having the people that built it continue working there. Instead, C-suite gets wine and dined by some salesman and they go with something that looks hot and sexy because it has a GUI. Except that their entire offering is cobbled together through various acquisitions and the people who programmed it are long gone. So when you ask them how their system works, they say they'll get back to you in a week. And then you have to prove them wrong because somehow, you know their system better than they do. Can you tell I'm a bit frustrated?"
"100% my experience with even things as omnipresent as HR software - and the more niche the use-case, the worse it is."
"Mine still uses AS/400. There is no end in sight. It's pretty effective, but the learning curve is high if you've never used anything but Windows/Mac, and it's not super user friendly. Our corporate team have done a really good job of documenting it, so our online help function is actually helpful if one bothers to use it.

I've been using it for almost 18 years and I'm the go-to person if anyone has a question about it. I have worked in 4 different depts. here so I am pretty knowledgeable about it. However, I am not in tech support or even tech support adjacent and I don't have any admin credentials. I don't mind helping someone who is new, but the more tenured people need to figure it out. PRESS F1 FFS. It gets old."
"There's AS/400, then there's [TPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_Processing_Facility). Yuck."
">If it works, why change it?

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic because text, but reasons to change it even if it works could include ""It's not supported by machinery that can be replaced"", ""It's not capable of doing things that it should be able to"", ""It runs entirely locally and no redundancies can be created in case something fails"", etc. etc.

It's entirely possible that the London subway system's got people who can still maintain that programming and hardware, but they would be rare and expensive and likely had to be specifically trained extensively by the city.  After a while it will need to be replaced, just like literally everything.  Nothing lasts forever."

Mate, you're describing the whole ""integrated ecosystem"" of Biesse machines that my boss who never actually has to work with the shit has a massive boner for.

Biesse just kept buying companies that made machines they don't, do the absolute minimum to tie existing horrid software suites to each other without even doing the bare minimum of harmonizing symbology for basic functions, and now they sell this clusterfuck of never translated error messages and crashing bloated software suites as if it's actually one system.

Our cnc nesting cell has 4 terminals for 2 machines tied to each other. And whenever shit really starts hiccuping, none of those terminals can fix it, it needs to be done remotrly, either from our office, or by the technicians who installed the stuff.

I would much rather work on 30 year old German machinery with the terminal still running DOS. At least those don't pretend to do anything they can't and allow machinists to actually solve problems without calling in expensive support."
"I have the benefit of growing up when systems changed all the time so I was always learning something new, and although AS/400 is older than I am, it's should be fairly simple to a technologically minded person. Problem is, I feel like that's type of person is in short supply where this program is used, at least in my company lol"
"Well‚Ä¶. yeah. Obviously the system has been maintained the whole time. They didn‚Äôt make it 56 years ago and just let it run ever since. Different components of it have been added over the years using different languages, but it still operates on much of the same fundamental infrastructure.

What I was trying to point out was that just because it‚Äôs old doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad. A large amount of mission-critical software is old. But it‚Äôs been tested rigorously and it works. Rewriting the whole thing just to use newer languages really shouldn‚Äôt happen unless it‚Äôs necessary.

"Yeah, older IT systems tend to be better if no other reason then they have been battle tested and withstood the test of time.  Not universal, but there is strong correlation.

30-40 years ago programmers and IT folks tended to be in it for the love of the game - not the money.  The ""everyone should learn to code"" shit with mediocre folks chasing the dollars with zero passion more or less ruined the industry as a whole since.  Quality was far better when there was actual professional pride in what you did, and you were the weirdo nerd in the basement of your giant company and no one knew wtf you did."
"Yeah, people are really tied to using a mouse to navigate programs. Lots of people read slowly too, and some of those screens have a lot of info to take in. If you aren't a fast reader, or haven't memorized the paths you need, it's going to feel cumbersome. 

The number of people at my work who struggle with even the most basic stuff infuriates me.  Why does it feel like a program you have used daily multiple times a day for several years is brand new for you every single time?"

Happens all the time. The US gets intercepted too. Been going on for as long as airplanes could be intercepted.

Wonder how many times these troll flights were reported under trump.

Thanks for your insight :)
Why do they do it tho?
"Thank you for perspective! Too often it's like, ""....is that a bad thing? Should we be worried?"""
"Yeah, they do it to the UK all the time too. They fly these big Tu-95s at our airspace and get us to launch a couple Typhoons to escort them. Probably just to be annoying and test our response times."
"Thanks for the real world insight. These activities have been going on since the Cold War  between both nations. Occasionally the TU bombers come down the coast to the lower 48. I‚Äôm not sure how common that is, but it seems to be news worthy."
"I was about to say, I feel like I hear this happening constantly"
"I assumed Santa had outsourced delivery at this busy time, Ho Ho ho"
Yep. Off the coast of Alaska also means off the coast of Russia.
"To be fair, we do it way more, Russia just doesn't know and we don't tell the.."
Thank you for your service. Sometimes it takes forever to find posts like these.
Gotta make sensational news somehow!
Trump is going to have his media goons squash any stories about future events from ever happening for the next 2-4 years.
Yes but that doesn‚Äôt confirm my echo chamber that WW3 has already begun and Biden is actually dead and Ukraine invaded russia! Stop being logical! It hurts Russian/GOP propaganda

"I was actually looking for the NORAD Santa and came here.  Top comment about nothing unusual, greatly comforted this old lady.

I think them may actually just be 4 of Santa's reindeer on their way to work this evening.
do we think that maybe that was just Santa?
My family and I just called NORAD‚Äôs Santa phone number. Operated told my kids to go to bed early because Santa will be there at 9pm. 10/10 customer service over there in the North.
This wasn't the NORAD news I wanted on Christmas Eve.
"I'm seeing early  reports of a downed reindeer near McGuire AFB, speculation it was dazzled by lasers and crashed."
You serious? This must have been a technical error.
Some reporter and their editor saw clicks on the website and went for it. Fearmongering is great for ad revenue.
"Russia routinely flies in NATO airspace, heading towards national airspace. It's the national airspace that provokes a response. They get challenged and change course, but always remain in international airspace. It happens frequently, NATO does it to Russia. It's just posturing. 

Media will report it whenever it suits their agenda."
"Are you pitching that for a movie?  Here, take my money üçø"
They won‚Äôt be.   Putin and Trump love each other.  Frump wants to be best friends with the big brother he so desperately wants to be like.
"The drones aren't carrying munitions capable of carpet bombing an area, dummy. Allowing a foreign nation to violate your airspace with strategic bombers is a step much higher than domestic drone use and people confusing airplanes in an approach pattern with UFOs/UAPs.

How many dozen miles are there countries separated by? ‚ÄúOff Alaska‚Äôs coastlines‚Äù is another way of saying ‚Äúoff eastern Russia‚Äôs coastlines.‚Äù

It actually wouldn‚Äôt shock me if that‚Äôs why the article was published today. Lots of extra eyes on NORAD so extra clicks so extra ad revenue
Confirmed. RFK Jr seen loading reindeer carcass on to the roof of his SUV.
"It isn't the military making these stories. Sensationalist media does its own work.

The Pentagon does not depend on you being scared for funding."
"How is this scaring the civilians?

"Surely OP will delete this post as it has been thoroughly dunked on and is not ""news""... right?"
And not nearly as flamboyant as those guys on the India/Pakistan border who scream and stomp their feet at each other.
Whoa whoa these aren't the war thunder forums
That part of Russia is even North American
Closest is 3 miles.¬† Seriously.
"He is hoping he gets free ""magic dust"" with his dinner"
"Nobody is suggesting the military is hanging on by a thread, and is only being kept afloat by scaring civilians. 

What is being suggested is fear helps republicans convince civilians that spending waaaaaaaaaaay too much on the military is a good thing."
"Those people won't get scared. But those who get their news off of headlines and 30 second, sensational shorts will"

"Any Spark drivers want to chime in on this? Was an account automatically opened in your name when you signed up? Were you forced to use it? Was there a part where you had to  sign to agree to opening the account? 


I've seen a few corporate places attempt similar, but never automatically, more as a preferred option they tried to trick you into using. ""Get paid on our VISA card, it's in your account quicker and easy to access!.""   Small print:  there is a fee for every time you want to get cash or move the money to another account."

"If only there were some kind of employee's worker's rights.

For instance, if my employer tried to force me to use a particular bank account that I had no interest in, desire to use, or control over, and then threatened my job if I didn't comply, then I'd have them on the local news by the afternoon.

The US is such a weakling when it comes to ""but my job..."" shite."
I remember when WM got busted for opening life insurance policies for their elderly employees. Just waiting for them to kick so WM can collect....
And Trump is going to shut down the CFPB
Someone better be going to prison for this.
"This is the agency Trump and Musk want to get rid of, one of the few systems in place to help defend and support us against mega corporations and greed."
I owe my soul to the company store.
"Don‚Äôt worry, by this time next year the CFPB will be gone and Walmart will never have to worry about this again."
"Stupid move on Walmarts behalf. Independent Contractors vs employees is a very fine line, and dictating how workers receive funds is definitely not leaning toward being independent. The back classification of these workers will be peanuts compared to the taxes owed by them."
"Disgusting practice.  It's a real shame that this case will probably end up being dropped because idiots elected a man who will, almost certainly, de-staff the CFPB if not completely eliminate the organization."
I'm ok with regularly stealing shit from Walmart. And they are too actually.
Always the people you most expect‚Ä¶
">President-elect Donald Trump is expected to choose a new CFPB director. It‚Äôs unclear what that means for this case

Depends. How much has the Walton family spent at Mar-a-lardo lately? Have they kissed the ring yet?"
Over 1 million people have worked as Walmart delivery drivers???
"Guess who wants to get rid of CFPB??? His name rhymes with ""dump."""
Sounds like Walmart hired the former Wells Fargo executives & employees who were opening secret accounts in customers/clients' names without their knowledge & consent.
I have not shopped at Walmart in two yesrs..
"Doesn't matter, trump is probably just gonna appoint Sam Walton III to head the CFPB or something stupid."
Now do Comdata. Can't get paid in Trucking a lot of times without it going on Comdata first and having to pay a fee.
Doesn‚Äôt matter. CFPB is on the chopping block as soon as Trump gets in.
"We became foster parents in NY and they signed us up, without permission, for a Fintwist account that charged fees for everything. We ended up dropping out of the program for this and many other reasons after reporting them to the state because in NY it‚Äôs absolutely illegal. We even had to force them to send us a direct directly for all the money in the account because they wouldn‚Äôt allow us to cash out without occurring ATM fees and stealing a $5 fee. Fuck Fintech ‚Äúbanks‚Äù, many aren‚Äôt FDIC insured or eligible and if the bank shuts down your money is gone for good. We‚Äôre seriously heading straight towards a run on the banks and a new Great Depression, secure your retirement or savings now and keep some cash hidden at home for an emergency."
Good thing Prpresident Musk wants to shut down the peaky CFPB. Those drives should be thankful. /S
"They'll get a fine, and it will be equal to the ""cost of doing business"" while they still rake it in."
"Obama created the CFPB and it is target #1 for new administration as ""wasteful"""
"Yeah I‚Äôve been delivering groceries for them for a few years now. They forced us to use this branch account. So we get paid weekly and then, since I have an actual bank account, I have to transfer it and wait til the next day for my money. Or, you can pay a fee for instant that‚Äôs like a percentage of it, but I would never do that.¬†

It‚Äôs still always been super annoying having to take an extra step to get my money into the place where I pay all my bills and stuff. DoorDash and uber etc have no issue just paying me direct deposit, like literally every other company inthe last 25 years.

Here‚Äôs hoping this gets us the ability to use ACH.¬†"
In before Walmart releases another woe is me press statement about record thefts and lack of workforce.
Musk/Trump stated they will eliminate this agency. Problem solved.
They made $166 billion last year...
"Lol so I caught my state issuing Refugee Cash Assistance rca, on bogus opened bank accounts. 

They opened them all on their main office number and addy, generic ssn, and just used their names that were valid.


This stuff happens alllll to often. The thing is though banks hardly even attempt to prevent these things because they only want the balance on their sheets which they use as a performance metric."
"The punishment won't even cover the profits they gained from breaking the law.¬†


We need to hold CEOs accountable for the actions of their company.¬†"
Incoming administration will end the CFPB.
Not too surprising coming from the largest abuser of public assistance programs in the country
"Used to work for a big bank. They had a policy where employee salaries would only be paid into a bank account of said bank. Genuinely, it was a fucking intern during their summer holiday placement who meekly raised 'Isn't it illegal to force employees to have a certain bank account to be paid?', a senior manager basically backed her comment that it seemed iffy. The next meeting external counsel confirmed that it was in fact unlawful and the policy ended immediately."
"They're gonna probably get like, 200 millions $ fine and that's it. Justice done"
"I can't help but think that attitudes like this song could have helped.  I doubt a strong union would have allowed something like this without some form of discussion.  I don't have experience being in a union,  but I was a non-union member manager for an SEIU job site, and it ran smoother than my other non-union sites.  Had a good relationship with the steward and she and I were accountable to our promises for getting the work done.

However, the owner of the company hated that he couldn't bring up profitability at the SEIU sites.  

That company had part of the onboarding process of signing up hourly employees for a debit card...then it was between the employee and the card company any fees...I'm not aware of any nefariousness with doing it, other than trying to save printing and postage costs for payroll checks."
"Unfortunately, this is very similar to what a lot of trucking companies force on their drivers."
Don‚Äôt worry Walmart! Musk and his VP Donald are coming to eliminate the CFPB.
"This reminds me of when I was a server at Olive Garden ~6 or 7 years ago. Instead of giving our credit card tips to us in cash at the end of the shift like most restaurants do, they were instead loaded onto debit cards that I‚Äôm pretty sure had a fee every time you used them. You *could* withdraw the funds for free, but the only way to do so was to go to a specific brand ATM. I don‚Äôt remember being able to opt out of it at all either."
Walmart has a *million* delivery drivers?
They used to buy life insurance for their employees so they could cash in on their deaths.
Walmart ia famous of taking out expensive life insurance  on their elderly door greeters and other employees ans making hundreds of thousands each when they die.
Opted into the one account when I worked there and kept it. It‚Äôs honestly a decent bank and 3% cash back when shopping at Walmart ain‚Äôt bad but what the fuck Walmart? If they didn‚Äôt opt in why tf
Walmart showed up on my credit history as an inquiry. Never shop there. Concern?
"So is there any explanation from Walmart other than what they are saying in the article? This article is obviously one sided, but of course we all like to judge the big corporations without both sides of the story. 

By the way, my cousin is a Walmart delivery driver, and this didn‚Äôt happen to him."
Does companies like that still take out life insurance policies on its employees? You know they can borrow money from those policies just like the employees can.
">	‚ÄúThe CFPB‚Äôs rushed lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law,‚Äù the company said in a statement Monday. ‚ÄúThe CFPB never allowed Walmart a fair opportunity to present its case during their rushed investigation. We look forward to vigorously defending the Company before a court that, unlike the CFPB, honors the due process of law.‚Äù

They did that shitüíÄüíÄüíÄ"
There is a very good chance the CFPB will be eliminated under the Trump Administration. Elon Musk has specifically called for it.
"nothing will happen id reckon

or the punishment is so absurdly miniscule for walmart that it wont matter"
This is the Agency trump wants to abolish.
"President Elmo wants CFPB closed, problem solved."
isnt that identity theft?
Sounds like 1 million counts of identity theft to me.
"It gets uglier‚Ä¶ 

**And drivers paid a combined total of $10 million in ‚Äújunk fees‚Äù to transfer those wages into other bank accounts, CFPB alleges.**"
"If you did this to one person, you'd be prison. This happened to over 1 million people, and nobody is going to get locked up."

"I worked for Brookdale Senior Living several years back. Shitty company by the way. When I was first hired, the ONLY way I could be paid was through some shitty online system called Skylight Pay Card or something like that. It's not a checking account. There's no way to transfer funds to your bank account. Complete scam of a system. I couldn't do anything via their online system.

In order to get my money without an ATM with fee or using some convoluted mess with multiple accounts or a friend via PayPal or something, I had to call customer support. They had an infuriatingly convoluted system. Everything is designed to make you give up and use their card! Eventually, they sent me some special checks in the mail. You then have to call a phone number to get your cardholder approval number that you have to fill in on the check. Then there's another number you have to call to get your authorization number that also must be entered on the check. Then finally I filled out the check to myself for my full account balance and deposited it into my USAA account using their app.

USAA makes online deposits available immediately, so I was worried to spend it until I knew it cleared. It was such a a hassle for no damn reason.

I work for a university now, and payroll is so damn easy. The last nursing home I worked at was also super easy. If there's a shitty way to do something that makes things harder on an employee, Brookdale Senior Living is most likely doing it that way."
"Oh, just send someone to assassinate the CEO. So hot right now."
"IANAL, but is this not being prosecuted criminally? This is literally an article about them being taken to court over this.

Fwiw, it's also alleged, and they maintain their innocence."
"The amount of theft from the rich stealing from the poor under Trump's 1st term was nothing short of spectacular. The Pandemic only hastened it. Remember, probably 90% of the chuds who cry foul at student loan forgiveness was given thousands, if not MILLIONS, of dollars and then it was ""forgiven"" despite no oversight (and even now we are still finding out thousands of cases of the funds going right into the owner's pockets rather than used to keep their employees.

And this happened when there were still a few sane GOP members left in his cabinet. Now it's just the worst of the worst sycophants who will help President Elon Musk and VP Trump just do whatever they want to do."
Is it any wonder Leon Musk is foaming at the mouth to abolish the CFPB? It has the absolute gall to protect everyday people and not the owners of government!
Pretty sure this is close to the very definition.
It‚Äôs always the ones you most suspect.
I think Wells employees were opening accounts in customers names so they could get bonuses for getting each customer up to the mandated number of accounts.
"That was different. WF opened ""ghost accounts"" for people because their employees operated on a quota/commission basis for new accounts. The accounts were never known about by the account holder.

Walmart is creating checking accounts for their employees to receive direct deposit pay checks. The employees are fully aware of the accounts existence. Since these accounts were the default option and had junk fees, the CFPB is suing them."
McDonald's was doing this about 10 years ago.
Wells Fargo ‚Äúgot in trouble‚Äù with a fine so minimal they still profited handsomely from their fraud.
"Employees were tacking checking and savings accounts onto existing accounts. The account holders wouldn't really notice, and the employees would get referral bonuses for the new accounts."
Yes. Both sued by CFPB
"Corporations break the laws on a regular basis, this is just yet another case where they got caught. It really is a two tier justice system. As others have pointed out, if a normal person or small business did something like that, they would go directly to prison as it's clearly a case of identify theft. They were not authorized to use that information that way, so that's fraud... That's a very serious crime, people should be going to prison for a very long time.

But, watch, they're going to get a fine, that they're going to pay with other people's money and not their own. So, there is no punishment at all. Nothing will happen to the people who broke serious laws, because ""it's Walmart."" Meanwhile, they've been using the media to market the idea that Walmart is actually the victim, because people keep stealing from them, but they're committing fraud, so why would people give money to criminals? It's a totally corrupt system."
Just wanted to say a big Fuck You to the guys in the first Trump administration that tried to gut it
They don't realize organizations like this keep the lynch mobs at bay.
"I love the CFPB. When sandy springs bank took $100 and locked it up and was trying to force me to drive 2 hours to come into a branch for verification, the CFPB saved me. After filing a report, I had a call from the head of compliance a day later and a check overnighted a day after that."
They‚Äôre really determined to cause another 2008 bc all these orgs they‚Äôre going after were created in response to that:
Getting rid of the FDIC will also be a boon for big banks. No one will want to risk their money in a local community bank and go with the 'too big to fail' guys that always get a bailout.
"Part of it is that the CPFB was Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs baby. IMO it needs to be way more robust. If we‚Äôre going to be handed over to corporations, they should at least not be able to rip us off so openly."
"When Elon tweeted his shit take on CFPB not even the MAGAS agreed with him which is a super rarity on Twitter.

This is a pure oligarchy move."
"When spark came out yes. It was the only option in order to receive funds. There was a fee to get money instantly, however it was free for ACH deposits to your regular bank account. We were paid only once a week for the longest instead of having the funds instantly available like most other gig apps. Now they offer other options lol."
"When I first started driving for Spark in 2021, we had direct deposit to the financial instituation of our choice. Then they brought in Branch and we were forced to used them. No opt out, no choice, no prior authorization. They just set everyone up and said here is your link to your online bank account.  It took three months before my credit union was a part of the online transfer network for the free transfer. My husband and I were both drivers and were forced to use the Branch card for our transactions or else pay large fees to transfer. People figured out shortcuts to transfer money but I shouldn't have to find work arounds to freely access my money. Everything in the 60 page filing is true. I actually reported this to CFPB back in late 2021."
"I never drove for spark, but I'm approved on all the driving platforms for extra cash just in case anything unexpected comes up. as of summer of 2023 it was mandatory to use their bank and to my knowledge you could not link your earnings to any other bank.

the app was immediately deleted when that popped up on the initial setup."
"Been doing it a few years now. I made another comment, but they forced me to use branch, even tho I have an actual bank, and DoorDash, uber etc have no issue paying me direct deposit. So when I get paid from spark I have to wait an extra day for the transfer to my bank. I pay all my bills and keep track pf my money in the bank account, I never wanted branch. Im hoping this gets us ACH.¬†

The only way this can cost someone money is if they use rhe instant transfer, then it‚Äôs a percentage of it, im not sure. I would never pay¬†"
"I love how you‚Äôre being downvoted by bootlickers. 

These idiots think corporations care about them. Or that they are the next millionaire in waiting."
But the media says he's a bad guy. Surely there wouldn't be any corporate interest at play here /s
"They know they can target and intimidate workers who are desperate for money/hours. 

The article calls out that the typical worker is female, has kids, and no college education. So the workers are most likely in need of money to care for their kids and don‚Äôt have the luxury of a savings account and waiting for a better job, and can be bullied into shutting up and taking the bank account that was illegally created. And then on top of that shit sandwich, the cherry is potentially paying additional fees on a tiny paycheck to transfer their money to another bank."
"Yeah‚ÄîI wish that our news stations could keep up, but the corruption is so rampant that it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúnews.‚Äù"
There is no way that‚Äôs profitable for Walmart. insurance company wouldn‚Äôt offer such policy where they lose money
"Life insurance policies are standard practice in most businesses. It's very cheap for employers to obtain and they only need one pay out to make it worth it. 

In fact, my current employer has a $25k payout as a ""perk"" along with 401k, etc. I had to explain to my coworker that it wasn't for us, it's for the business because their payout is at least 10x that. Granted, we could up ours for like $1-3 a month."
Clogging their toilets has become an obsession.
Fuck them. Most of them voted for Trump.
"WM gets tax breaks for hiring the elderly, veterans, and the disabled. Corporate isn't doing that out of the goodness of their heart."
"And as we know, insurance companies love giving out money. /s

Statistically insurance companies should earn more from policies than they pay out, otherwise they screwed up."
"I remember hearing about this when I worked there and I think they were still able to make a claim up to 3 or 4 years after the employee left the company, although that was probably just a rumor."
Can you provide a link to substantiate that claim?
This totally happened when they first rolled out Branch. I was a driver. I had free direct deposit to my credit union through DDI and then they brought in Branch and they didn't give us a choice to opt out. They literally sent us a link and said here is your account that we set up on your behalf.
"Companies taking out life insurance on employees, called ‚Äújanitor‚Äôs insurance‚Äù or ‚Äúdead peasant insurance‚Äù is a separate thing. These policies are legal and common but they‚Äôre regulated to make sure everyone knows what‚Äôs going on and that it‚Äôs fair. Companies can‚Äôt just borrow money from these policies whenever they want bc there are rules and consequences. Employees usually know about these policies and can sometimes get something out of them."
"sounds like. the last time a bank was caught doing this, not much happened. there has been and will continue to be a layered justice system. look at gaetz, they know and have evidence on him. nothings happening. trump committed so many damn crimes that just 1 would land any of us in jail without being able to walk around free.

it is wage theft, but its only identity theft or punishable if we did it. its just a 'you should do this, so hide it better next time' slap on the wrost so it looks like something happened."
Bank fraud too
Wells Fargo wanted 8 accounts per customer because 8 rhymed with great.
Bullet Bills suit him better.
I got a Reddit warning for that post. They are bought.
"Where I live everyone has an LLC in their back pocket. When the PPP program came out you wouldn't *believe* the explosion of new BMWs, Mercedes, and Audis. There's a graph somewhere that shows a huge leap in sales nationally."
"PPP was overwhelmingly bipartisan (passed 388-5 in the house) and was also extended by Biden. One of the few things both sides agreed on.

Obviously it was severely flawed in hindsight, but at the time politicians were just trying to avoid a huge economic downturn."
Our whole system is designed to extract wealth from the poor.  Trump is a symptom but the disease infects the whole body.
And Trump will get to pick a new director of CFPB so I'm sure Walmart is real worried about the outcome of this...
"Don't forget about them also wanting to abolish the FDIC.

Good luck getting everyone to buy their first homes and pay their rents when everyone loses their life savings in the collective bank runs."
Not just bonuses but to meet quotas.  WF was so sales oriented at that time and they constantly pushed selling customers more accounts.  So employees would open accounts without the customers' knowledge and their bosses turned a blind eye because everyone needed to hit the ridiculous quotas coming from the top.  People could lose their jobs if they weren't meeting those crazy quotas.
Pretty sure that‚Äôs part of what is going on here.
Was the wf thing before online banking? Wouldn‚Äôt customers notice additional accounts in their app?
"You should read up more on the fallout of that scandal. The Fed capped their assets, so they can‚Äôt effectively grow the company. As far as punishments for a bank, that‚Äôs kind of a big one."
They made ~$0 from the fraud and got fined billions of dollars. Their own employees were scamming the company to meet quotas so they wouldn't be fired.
Another big fuck you to the asshole idiots who voted for it again
"There is a huge overlap between the selfishness of right wingers and lack of impulse control, lack of foresight, and just general greed.  They rarely have a secret grand plan, it is just ""MORE MORE MORE, GIMME GIMME"" without any heed to the possible consequences.

You absolutely can have a stable, hierarchical society that lasts for generations.  It has developed a few different times over the centuries of human history.  But it is rare, BECAUSE it requires the greedy people to have some self-imposed limits.

Instead it is much more common that the rich and powerful keep demanding more and more until someone gets sick and tired of it, and decides that they have nothing left to lose.

Americans as a whole have too much to lose still, but if a couple more cycles of GOP control lead to another major depression, that may change.  You can already see it bubbling up with things like the reaction to not just Luigi, but also OceanGate, orcas attacking yachts, etc."
"And the weirdest thing is the big banks don‚Äôt really want this as they want to maintain consumer confidence, more just everything consolidated under the occ. what they really seemingly want is the government to crush fintech with regulations, because they‚Äôve already complied with / Wells Fargo has already done the cost of doing business of the fine analysis."
There are only additional fees if you do the instant. If you do the regular it says 3-5 days but it‚Äôs there the next. Not to defend this - I just want ACH.¬†
"Are you sure about that?  My wife's very large employer provides 1.5x annual salary life insurance policy that pays out to the employee beneficiary. My very small company provides $10,000 to an employee's beneficiary."
This is illegal unless you are the top paid person in the company or a key person to the company.

"My theory since the early PPP days is that most of the ""middle class"" asset inflation like housing was PPP driven.

A back pocket LLC doesn't help you a ton unless you are willing to cross over into actual felony fraud - this number of people is smaller than most believe.  Being a shitlord ""small business owner"" who has 12 employees made you a millionaire overnight with zero fraud involved - it was literally the program as-designed.  

PPP paid 80% of your payroll for ~9 months or so.  If you can't end up with a free home and $100k truck after that, you aren't playing the game very well.

It showed that my thoughts of ""America is fraud bottom to top"" while ""coming up"" from being homeless in my teens to a professional career today were 100% accurate.  It's fraud all the way down - the only difference between Trump and the average American is Trump can get away with it.  COVID showed that people will ""get theirs"" the second they have even a small amount of money that they can claim unethically."
"The devil is in the details with PPP loans. The SBA was tasked with issuing PPP loans and the SBA under Trump thought the free market (banks) would regulate it themselves. What ended up happening was quite the contrary. When Biden came into office and passed the cares act 2.0 it had a lot more oversight built in and a new head of the SBA.  
Importantly, Linda McMahan was the head of the SBA prior to the pandemic and Chris pilkerton was acting (non confirmed) during the pandemic."
"I will point out that while both sides agreed with it, and I agree with it as well, the law as passed had significant oversight of the funds involved. However the Trump administration refused to actually implement that oversight."
Feature not a bug. That's how they get all our houses so they can rent them back to us. Even the ones owned outright. They're betting on the next Great Depression and they're in position to profit off it.
Sounds like we need to actually legislatively ban the use of quotas in all sales platforms involving financial services or any service where PPI is required to open accounts.
"I think a bigger part of what Walmart is doing is since the funds are in their bank for a longer time, they make money on that money so the funds cost them less. In addition to charging junk fees to the off book employees to access their own funds.

Also‚Ä¶since their bank has more money in it they can do more. Banks are only required to keep a certain amount of cash on hand."

The class war has been going on for a long time. If you think it's on its way your side is already getting its ass kicked.
"disparity might be worse but we have more comforts* and still live better than they did. so we cant look at it, sit on our thumbs and say change is around the corner."
"People always say this like it makes things somehow better. 

It‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs a room we‚Äôre all forced to walk into while a man in a suit stands at the door with a baseball bat. The man breaks both of your arms, knocks your teeth out and breaks one leg. It‚Äôs the entry fee for the room. 

Everyone starts complaining about the absurdity of being forced to have arms, a leg and teeth broken just to walk in this room that we don‚Äôt have a choice but to enter. Inevitably, somebody sitting in the corner trying to stick their teeth back in with broken arms takes the time to defend the baseball wielding man, blood bubbling from their lips with each word, ‚Äúthey used to break both legs so we actually have it better than ever before.‚Äù As though not bludgeoning every member of society for simply existing just isn‚Äôt an option.

I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for some people to see that the system has always been fucked. It‚Äôs always been rigged against us. And even if they might see it, they just can‚Äôt imagine another type of system. The man with bat has always existed and therefore must always exist, it‚Äôs unthinkable to enter the room any other way. A lack of imagination, in my opinion."
Good point‚Ä¶
"But in Mario Kart you actually have to work to get to and stay in 1st place. It takes talent, practice and effort. Most of these CEOs never worked for a damn thing."
I got zero - because I'm self employed.  It should never have been PPP paycheck protection.  It should have been income supplement directly to everyone - screw trickle down.
Yep. How many people out there took the money and were smart enough to invest it sensibly?
"Agreed, but I think that‚Äôs missing some context.

The whole point of PPP was to prevent people from getting laid off. Unemployment had skyrocketed and the idea was to prevent those layoffs from occurring instead of just boosting unemployment to offset it.

That needed to happen quickly and reducing oversight to increase speed makes sense in that context. Biden‚Äôs decision to increase that oversight as there was less of a crisis at the time and the economy was recovering was also sound.

At the end of the day, the U.S. recovered better than most if not all peer countries, and the gov is still working to track down fraud. While the fraud sucks, I think the end result was better than most people want to acknowledge."
Gee I wonder why.
"I know when WF was caught that they got rid of the quotas.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear that they have come back in some form though.  I haven't kept up and I certainly don't trust them.

Every year WF was increasing sales quotas.  When the recession happened, WF stopped lending as much so it was harder to push loans and such yet WF still imposed higher sales quotas so you had more and more sales people opening up extra checking and savings accounts.

I agree, it's a disgusting practice.  WF wanted going to the bank to feel like walking onto a used car lot."
Just another way to squeeze out a few more dollars out of a little guy.¬†

"The disparity is worse, but as long as people can afford food, nothing will happen.

It wasn't just the wealth disparity was extreme during that time, it was specifically that there was a major food shortage happening starting in 1788 due to poor grain harvests as a result of drought. By 1789 people were starving to death; and this was the most severe of food shortages that had been happening with increasing frequency and severity since about 1760. This was in conjunction with an overly punitive taxation policy on the lower classes which made it even harder for them to afford what food that was available.

So in other words, it took prolonged food insecurity, overly aggressive taxation on the lower and middle class to set the stage of the Revolution; followed by it all finally blowing up in the face of the monarchy when they tried to raise taxes far past what the lower classes could afford whilst being in the midst of the worst food shortages the kingdom had faced in centuries.

That's what it took to spark the French Revolution. So unless we see the sudden collapse of American agricultural production, I don't think its very likely that we will see overt rebellion over class warfare."

"What.. self employed qualified in second round. I was able to get enough to cover 2 months of income, which isn't buying multiple properties kind of money but it helped stay afloat as I lost a few clients and wasn't able to meet new ones. It was basically entirely meant for small businesses like us.

Edit: You people need to seriously stop upvoting this dudes misinformation. He is 100% wrong. Sole proprietors qualified during second round. Nothing was required beyond your 2019 or 2020 schedule c. It took all but 10 minutes to apply."
Are you saying that when the world shut down and people were given money to cover their income so they didn't default or otherwise go bankrupt that they should have invested it? That's explicitly *not* what PPP was for.
"Do you have any idea of what you had to do in order to obtain a PPP loan? It was a signed affidavit - that's it. The SBA could have required something like the company's 2019 tax returns or even required the founding LLC documents to ensure the company was formed prior to April 2020 and had the lending bank do the due diligence or face a large fine later. Nah, instead, a signed form under penalty of perjury is all you need - then we'll blame Joe biden four years later for fraud and abuse during the pandemic.  
There was little excuse for how comically the roll out of PPP loans was done or that donald trump needed to sign the stimulus checks from the treasury, causing a delay in getting those funds out to every American."

"Ok, I'll concede that point!"
I qualified for ziltch.  Certainly not PPP because I'm not an LLC or INC - just a schedule-C dude.  Glad you got some.
Not true. I worked at a bank and personally processed PPP loans. We required tax returns and proof of payroll costs by person because there was a 100k/year income limit.
"Most PPP loans were not fraudulent by letter of the PPP.  The actual fraud of folks standing up LLCs and ""ghost companies"" and such is minor compared to the ""fraud lite"" of having an actual business where you simply wanted your payroll paid by the government for the better part of a year.  That affidavit was singable by literally any business owner since the language was so easy - of course every single business owner had a belief that their business may be impacted by COVID in some way.  Positively or negatively it didn't matter.  

It was also set up in such a way that even if you were an ethical business owner you had to go for the program since your competitors surely were.  At least those guys plowed money back into business operations - but they were in the small minority.

The outright fraud was a drop in the bucket.  Most of the ""loans"" given out were 100% legit and done to the letter of the law.  Most of the ""omg fraud"" takes I've seen locally are indeed not fraud at all - just businesses using the program as-designed.

COVID confirmed to me the average American has zero morality or ethics.  Just justifications as to why they are able to take from the commons the second they get the chance to do so.  It wasn't just business owners either."
"Oh yeah, I'm certain they still track it.  They track everything."
TJMAXX makes their employees push credit cards. If you look at the subreddit you might catch posts where the cashier was pressured to sign up for a card from coworkers and managers (I was) or people even making up people to hit the quotas.

"17% fraud rate in PPP/eidl loans by the SBA's audits conducted in 2023 is *very* significant compared to just about any emergency or non emergency program conducted by the US government. Even katrina relief - panned widely for fraud and abuse only clocked in at 11%.  
We shouldn't be counting on people's better angels to guide government programs - as you noted and the Trump admin did little to stop the fraud and abuse as I've outlined."
They do that shit at walgreens too.
understood. ill cross out the previous post
"I upvoted you - you are correct.  But... 2019 vs 2020...  the gumint cherry picked the months to review - and they reviewed my BEST 2020 months, and worst 2019 months, and hence it looked like I did better during 2020, so I got nothing.  Despite overall have WAY less income in 2020."
"The PPP rules that the banks had to follow are public and published in the Federal Register.  However, Trump‚Äôs team kept changing the rules for the first 3 months or so, so one would have to search across all publication dates."
"17%, so about 1 in 5.  Given the size of the PPP (roughly enough to give every American man, woman, and child $25,000), that's quite a lot."
"There wasn't cherry picking of anything for first loan. You submitted 2019 -or- 2020 net income (whichever was greater is what you should use), which comes from your schedule c. They allowed either year to account for 2020 being a bad year during COVID. Your return would be 2.5 months worth of gross profit. This was literally as simple as taking yearly income divided by 12 then multiplying by 2.5. So it will never be nothing unless you literally earned nothing for 2 years. Even forgiveness was a simple EZ form as anything below 150k was fast track forgiven.

You're trying to make this program sound like it was terrible for small businesses, but it wasn't. It was fantastic, easy, and guaranteed return. That's part of why it was so easy to abuse. Second round even had funds left before it ended so it's not like they just ran out of money either. The businesses that missed out on it frankly need to learn a thing or two about running a business. I'm guessing those same businesses are missing out on tax incentives too if a simple single page form was too complicated.

The only time there was ""cherry picking"" is if you were applying for a SECOND loan. Things got A LOT more strict in that regard as you had to show a 25% loss for 1 quarter from 2019 to 2020. Even then for a lot of businesses that was easy enough to prove."

"So the EPA permits Florida to test this shit, yet manufactured/lab-grown meat is illegal to produce, sell, or buy.

The state of Florida is a shithole. Born and raised there, the only place I had ever called home, but so, so glad I got away."
This reads like one of those things that people a century from now will shake their heads at.
Why? The article didn't say if there's a reason for it. Is it supposed to last longer? It just seems like their looking for a way to dump radioactive material somewhere without paying to store it or get rid of it
"Great, more media scare tactics.

Headline: RADIOACTIVE ROADS COMING TO FLORIDA, EPA APPROVES OF IT

Actual information: They're doing testing on barely radioactive byproducts that normally just sit around needing expensive disposal or storage. The gypsum would be entirely diluted with normal road base, extending how much road can be built will completely dispering the radioactive material to undetectable levels. The pilot program needed approval to actually do any further testing on environmental impact and true viability, as most of this is basically just theory that they need to do small-scale testing on. Provided I read the article right.

I really fucking hate how the media and people in general see the words ""radioactive"" and ""nuclear"" and immediately jump to conclusions. Modern nuclear EVERYTHING is very clean, even the bombs don't poison cities and turn the land into a Fallout game. Your cellphone emits radioactive energy, and yet we hand em to kids to play with. Planes expose people to A LOT of radiation, and yet we allow children to fly alone across the planet multiple times a year for stuff like visitation.

Don't get scared, get educated. Don't be told what to believe, find the truth. It's out there on the internet, right alongside all the bait that says nukes will make countries uninhabitable and that the earth is flat and that the moon is a NASA projection and that wi-fi/5G gives people cancer/heart problems."

"So to add a bit more context. The main radioactive element that would be included if this goes on to be more than a test is Thorium, with a half life of 14 billion years. That makes it sound super dangerous but the opposite is the reality. That's because it takes 14 billion years for half of a sample to emit radiation which means the amount of radiation emitted at any one time is extremely low. This means in applications like roads there's very little risks as Radon is the biggest concern and in a very open air application that's not a big concern. If instead this was to make cement to line basements this would be a bad application but roads should be fine. And that's exactly what is being tested by this test."
"For those people who read only the headlines, not the article. 
    
>The EPA said the 'approval applies only to the proposed pilot project and not any broader use'

>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved a controversial proposal that would lead to using phosphogypsum, a radioactive byproduct of the phosphate industry, in a road project.

>The EPA on Friday issued a notice of approval for Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of The Mosaic Company, to move forward with the pilot road project on company property in Polk County."
"This article is useless. It doesn't say how many bananas of radiation you'd get by commuting on such a road.

"Yea, knee jerk reactions aside, there is no harm in testing to see if something is viable or not.  It's not like the EPA is giving the greenlight to use phoshogypsum on public roads. 

That being said, even if the test shows that it's a viable method of storing it, doesn't mean it's cost effective compared to traditional materials used on roads. The safety requirements of handling radioactive material alone could make the cost using it rather than traditional material not cost effective"

"You are mostly right that it's about cost, as storing it is expensive and therefore it's almost like negative money if you wanted to make it into roads. Luckily it's extremely mildly radioactive and if put in roads it is unlikely to lead to any long term health consequences, and if it would this test is designed to detect any problems."
"Cell phones don't emit ionizing radiation.  (X-rays and alpha / beta particles)  radio frequency radiation is not harmful.

"Also, the chief threat of phosphogypsum is radium decaying into radon. Radon is bad, but it's a long-term exposure thing, and if this is just being used in the base, it's going to be capped by asphalt/concrete. Considering that a simple plastic vapor barrier around your foundation and a couple of vent pipes is considered safe in higher-risk areas, the risks here seem minimal."

RADIUM ROAD ; All roads Lead to Cancer in Future Florida
"It's a private company testing it not the EPA, I'm assuming they are interested in it because it's likely profitable."
"It is viable, it‚Äôs done in Europe, South America, Asia, Canada, and Africa - basically just about everywhere except the USA. 

It is a byproduct of fertilizer production, and ultimately needs to go somewhere - can either pay a lot of money to safely store it somewhere it gets no productive use, or use it for something productive. 

For roads, it is both a very cost effective material, and is also very good quality for roads since it is very dense and stable.

As far as radioactivity goes - it is very very slightly radioactive. So what? So is granite. So are bananas. 

This radioactivity is basically comparable to radon and not a real concern except if it‚Äôs in a confined space (like a basement)‚Ä¶ and roads are literally the opposite of the definition of ‚Äúconfined‚Äù. 

I live in florida, and I‚Äôd have no problem with this being used on local roads."
Unless the EPA rules are gutted by the supreme court then the material will require no special handling and as a waste byproduct will be cheaper to use.
"Agreed, but why you dropping phoshogypsum casually like it's a thing anyone knows lol"
"The danger of radiation is based on the exposure rate. When you have tons and tons of it just sitting doing nothing, yes it has to be stored in safe containers. But laying it out real thin on a small road that only cars will drive on, not a big deal. Thorium has been used in lots of things that, while concerning enough to consider alternatives, weren't really a hazard."
"This is a fun one.¬†


In 2003-2004 the US had a mad cow outbreak.¬†

After the outbreak, Japan requested all heads of cattle exported to them for human consumption be tested, which is something they already do domestically.¬†


The US refused, saying it would be an unnecessary additional cost for cattle producers.¬†


A premium US producer said they would test cattle being sent to Japan and requested kits from the USDA. The USDA refused, arguing doing so many create an unnecessary international standard (and, I'd argue, have had Americans ask why they weren't being protected in this manner).¬†

They are the ones who passed the bill to study it."
"Yes, it is, but you're missing the point. The issue here is Florida should've put up roadblocks to stop this at the state level.

"If it's radon that is the primary concern, then most of these comments should never drive through my neighborhood, since many houses are dumping radon directly into the atmosphere!"
"Radon isn't an issue at all in open air environments. It's only a hazard when concentrations get high because it can't escape from an enclosed space (like a home). As you said, where radon is a problem, the solution is to vent it outside. The roads are being built outside where this isn't an issue.

It's also a very strange thing to worry about given that radon is an inert gas that can travel through soils. Had this material never been mined, it would still be off gassing radon at the same rate leading to the same exposure for people outside."
Dihydrogen monoxide is terrifying I tell ya hwat
"> Also, a little lead in your fuel won't hurt anything right?

I mean, yeah. Depends on how much ""a little"" is. Mercury is known to be found in fish, and arsenic in rice, and that's not banned in any way either. 

That being said, there is a distinct lack of numbers in the article. So I can't say whether it's potentially lethal or as negligible as a banana."

usually its one fucked in the head rich guy pushing this sort of thing because they are currently paying fines and fees for disposal of it.
"The ""unprofitable' aspect is that whatever company is behind this, has been losing profit margin due to having to store this shit in a radio active containment facility ... And if they can con-vince the EPA into letting them sell as an asphalt substitute, then not only will they not have to pay the storage fees for 80 years; they will be able to make money from it.

P S. none of these executives will ever let their limos drive on these roads / already have all their water shipped in from Europe instead of drinking from America's water system."
"Well, yea. That's what companies do. Companies also do research and development on things and so much of that ends up going nowhere because it's not feasible for plenty of reasons."
"I‚Äôd be wagering long term storage of any radioactive substance probably comes with a substantial cost to where doing anything with it is cheaper. It might be more expensive than normal roads but still cheaper than storing it, cheap enough to eat the upfront cost of using it."
"> I'm assuming they are interested in it because it's likely profitable.

Yeah, but bringing down costs of road construction is something we can all benefit from."
"This. Radioactive could be anything from a banana to something that will cause your organs to disintegrate in a month. There is no reference point. What else can you do with acres of this stuff, if it is of any real risk, what the hell does it matter."
That's what the article is talking about
"But that assumes it never becomes a particle that is kicked up through wear and tear. That it‚Äôs safe for road workers to be exposed to. And that it doesn‚Äôt end up in the ground, water etc."
"""Only cars will drive on"" 

Yes. Completely ignore the natural world. It's really worked great so far. We definitely don't have to worry about how things affect anything outside of their intended uses. There's no need to look at an agricultural system that destroys viable soil while producing radioactive waste. Let's just make money off the waste instead. Problem solved."
What happens when they need to replace the road or something under it? Would a car fire do anything to it? It seems kind of silly to do it when asphalt works fine.

Before this all happened, the US generally tested animals that showed obvious signs of neurological disorder. They occasionally tested downer cattle or dead cattle, but this was inconsistent.¬†


I believe the numbers were around 1,000 head total tested per year in the US prior to 2002. The response to the case led to a broadening of testing to around 40k per year, which is targeting enough sensitivity to catch infection volumes at around 1 per million head of cattle (an infection volume of around 100 sick animals).¬†"
"For now, but a pilot project indicates an interest in this being, long-term, a broader scale thing.

You do know why we have those government agencies, right? Because private companies were actively raping the earth and letting people die for profit.

Is this Adele‚Äôs counsel ? It‚Äôs called plagiarism.. it‚Äôs more common now than in the past due to teams of writers creating a product rather than an artist writing a song. ¬†The machinery behind ¬†the Swifts and Adele‚Äôs of the world are paid to deliver hits on demand so they steal without hesitation and some times get caught. Just the price of doing business when there busted really.¬†

"She alredy lost the case, Sony and Universal will probably try to appeal."
"> There‚Äôs only so many ways you can arrange chords and ones that are popular are reused all the time.

But in this case it‚Äôs not just the chord progression, it‚Äôs also the vocal melody on top. It‚Äôs almost exactly the same."
Did you listen to the comparison between the two or are you claiming that plagiarism in music is literally never possible?
Love Pachelbel's Rant.
"Music is math. Mathematically speaking there is a finite amount of ways you can combine audible tones. That means all music is repetitive and has been done before. There is no such thing as a new chord progression.

As for pachabels canon, and songs like Air on the G string, people use those songs intentionally, but it‚Äôs not an issue because it‚Äôs public domain. But people do  sometimes plagiarize music nonetheless."
"I agree, but in this case it was pretty clear she just stole it. Lost some respect for something so blatant. 

No doubt there is going to be a convergence of ideas and creativity sometimes, but when you just straightup remix and steal other people's work like c'mon."

Unfortunatley long Edit: Just because Adele is more successful does not mean she is wrong. Plagiarism suit in music are dangerous cashgrabs that can and will be weaponized to shut down musical expression across the board. 

The artist suing Adele isn't suing over a sample, but basic melodic similarities. Similarities shared by dozens of songs across Latin America. The Adele song was compared to a Turkish song from 1985 upon its release. The Brazilian song came out in 1995.

The argument is a spurious cash grab by a has been, who expected to be able to leverage the cultural moment against a reputation consious Adele for a quick buck. The article mentions repeatedly how desperate the Brazilian artist was to stay out of court and keep things private, something i honestly find very suspicious given the supposed moral outrage he is feeling now."
No he shouldn‚Äôt. Desperate cash grab. He should get a job and stfu. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Nope. The chords and melody are extremely common. Hundreds of songs exist with em
Ironic because this video in itself is basically just a rip off of the same joke made in Pachelbel Rant by Rob Paravonian.
"Until all appeals are exhausted, nobody has won or lost."
It‚Äôs always the top line that hoses people. Not the chord progression.
It doesn‚Äôt sound the same
"There are finitely many possible chord progressions and melodies in western musical style but the number is massive.

The thing is there only a small set of that will appear in listenable non-experimental music and even a smaller subset that will appear in pop music."
"Totally agree with you, but I'll be pedantic in case anyone else is interested.  There are (literally) infinite ways to combine noises.  Other cultures use different tuning systems, and you can create your own if your so inclined. It might not sound good to western (or any) ears, but you can do it! 

What's interesting about music is how much you need to ""reference"" previous musical ideas, structures, melodies if you want a wide audience to enjoy it.  There's some pleasure people gain by listening to something that is familiar, with (relatively) slight changes."
"That's only really true if you stay in 12-tone equal temperament. The frequency for all sound waves is variable and continuous, so you can truly have an infinite number of songs. 

Due to the limits of human perception, you'd be right still, though, as you can't tell any difference between a note with a frequency of 380 hz and 380.00001 hz. 

Counterpoint to my own counterpoint, The true number of unique possible songs is far, far greater than the number of songs that have ever been written and sung, so your assertion that all music is repetitive and has been done before doesn't really hold water. 

Music made by humans follows patterns. Musicians who really like a song are going to end up creating songs that resemble the one they like, so we do have a bad tendency to be really repetitive with our music. This doesn't mean *all* music is repetitive, however. 

My b for dumping, I'm just passionate about the subject"
"Yeah, that's right"
"With 12 tones, each in minor and major and septime and a load of other variations, plus taking duration into account, it quickly adds up. 

12 tones * 4  chordtypes * 4 durations = 192. Each chord has sort of 3 melody notes. That makes 576. So for just 4 notes that makes 576^4 = which is more then 100 billion.

 I admit that not every combination will be a commercial success. But your math argument is a bit too easy."
I'm happy you referenced this so I didn't have to go look for it
"Lorde Lorde Lorde, ya ya ya"

If Pachelbel comes back from the dead he‚Äôs gonna be the richest man to ever live.
"I come from a classical music background where countless musicians will play the exact same song, and release albums and make money off them. I just find this obsession that two people can't sing the same or even similar pop music songs to be bizarre. People like to listen to Adele because she's Adele, and people who like to listen to that other guy do so because they are fans of that person, whoever they are, etc. If 1,000 different artists released their own versions of *Million Years Ago*, what's so bad about that? We'd have more variety, each version would sound different because each musician is unique."
I believe you.
Is this just the Ed Sheeran 4 chord suit all over again? Might as well just stop making new music then.
Why shouldn‚Äôt he?
"I love that you had to type this all out even though this is all in the article! People, READ THE ARTICLE BEFORE YOU COMMENT! Takes 3 minutes, jeez"
"You sound very hateful and bitter, are you ok"
"I actually wonder if the axis of awesome guys saw Rob's skit on the 8 chords before making their song on 4, since there's 2 years between (2006 and 2008). I can't find anything on it."
"It actually does. Even Adele‚Äôs lawyers admitted the melody was similar, but put it down to an ""accident"".

It happens a lot in music where an artist unwittingly copies another melody, e.g George Harrison ""My Sweet Lord"" and Radiohead ""Creep""."
"Technically not literally infinite, mostly because of the limits of our hearing of individual notes being graded; a note at 531.00000000001 Hz will sound exactly the same as a note at 531.00000000002 Hz for example. And in regards to noises, there‚Äôs only a limited number of noises possible. It‚Äôs unfathomably huge, but reduced by the grading and the possibility of human use, and is not infinite (though likely incalculable and functionally infinite for all practical purposes)."
"Pop music is also repetitive because while there are a great many ways to arrange progressions and melodies, when you're accounting for progressions being simple and in the same key and melodies being simple and catchy the amount of combinations shrinks dramatically. There's only an infinite amount of combinations if you don't care about contemporary song structure and the basics of songwriting and making memorable hooks. These people aren't producing long classical music pieces. They're making 4 chord simple pop tunes. The world isn't necessarily your oyster when working in the parameters of what typical (non musician/music nerd) people will actually like. The pop music formula is very limiting."
"I‚Äôm not saying commercial success. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs finite and it is.

Like even a child can accidentally and absentmindedly plink out a random, nonsensical tune on a rubber band, which would qualify as a tune that has been done before if you come up with the same random nonsensical tune and turn it into a hit. Of course, no one would ever accuse you of plagiarism in such a case, but it still wouldn‚Äôt be original, or a combination of tones that has never been heard before.


But my point is more that just because it sounds familiar doesn‚Äôt mean it was plagiarized. Throughout history there are sounds that appeal to us and sounds that don‚Äôt. These may change over time but in the end, popularly known music (folk, rock, classical etc) will all draw upon the sounds that appeal to us, which is a much more limited collection of sound than actually exists, which is why we frequently hear other songs in different ones."
"I didn‚Äôt say it was. This progression is really common in Hispanic music though, so if he‚Äôs suing Adele, he‚Äôd have a long list of Hispanic artists he should be suing first."
"Says ""video unavailable"" for me. Maybe it's blocked for certain countries?"
"I haven't listened to any of those songs until I was down voted like crazy.  
I just did and to my surprise they are very similar, forget about the samba drums and focus on the melody and you will see it's pretty much the same song.
What I was saying before is these judges check the number of notes that are the same and other metrics. One song could be a heavy metal and the other a gospel, it doesn't matter, if they share the same notes in sequence and rhythm, it will be considered plagiarism"
After seriously listening I agree this is just a way to get money. There's no way he will win it.
Its not just the chord but the melody as well
Could be. Fez wasn‚Äôt exactly presented as the brightest friend in the group.
Ska has to be one of the worst genres out there. It's just the same song over and over
"Right, I‚Äôm just more familiar with Hispanic music so I can‚Äôt say whether it is super common in all Latino music. But it‚Äôs a good clarification to make. Brazilian music has huge influence on the Hispanic music landscape."
"To call them phonetically similar is already a vague stretch (compare MILL YUN YEARS vs MOOL AIR ES), and their use melodically and rhythmically in the song is not remotely similar."
"What was it lana del ray that got sued for a plagerism for a song that sounds just like a radiohead song that sounds just like a song by the hollies. Suing over chord progressions is going to ruin music. Even tom petty suing sam smith was a stretch. There are maybe 4 chords in ‚Äúwont back down‚Äù, fucking ridiculous"
"Thankfully, the Led Zeppelin lawsuit corrected the Katy Perry suit."
"I'm sure you understand copyright and composers being paid for their work correct?

"Classical music is a bit different - the source music is old enough to be in the public domain, unlike all the other examples that are being discussed in this thread."
">  come from a classical music background where countless musicians will play the exact same song, and release albums and make money off them.

That used to be common even in non-classical music.  Hence the [Great American Songbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Songbook).  I love hearing different renditions by Nina Simone, Dinah Washington, Julie London, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday etc of the same song.    I love the songs more, and listen to more music, *because* of the different treatments.   I love comparing the versions of I Put a Spell on You, from Screamin' Jay Hawkins to Nina Simone to Marilyn Manson.   We lose so much by artists not having as much freedom anymore."

"> But my point is more that just because it sounds familiar doesn‚Äôt mean it was plagiarized

"Plenty of composers are still alive, and you've got several orchestras playing their work. Yet we don't hear of talk of one conductor stealing another conductor's interpretation of the same sheet music."
What about Tin Pan Alley? That music was covered and copied as soon as it was published and that was the whole point.
"Further, the melody is only similar if the music is replayed in the same beat. When played in their original format, they bear no resemblance. This scrub is literally trying to claim copyrights over a sequence of notes, irrespective of the final product. He needed to hire a band to demonstrate how they had been modified because you can‚Äôt tell just from listening.

Next we will have musicians suing each other for saying the same few words, or maybe even just loosely following the same intention. Your song is about love?! I DID THAT FIRST YOU OWE ME!"

"Sure, but the people you‚Äôre talking about that are all re-recording the same songs are using old material that‚Äôs in the public domain. There‚Äôs no point mentioning music by newer composers because very few artists are paying royalties to re-record newer material that still has ownership rights."
"I don‚Äôt know enough on Tin Pan Alley to be any kind of authority on the subject, but a bit of quick googling on the subject seems to suggest that there really was no way robust copyright protection until the latter part of the TPA music scene when ASCAP  was established in 1914.

He was making the same argument as this guy. ""Its not fair that the Coldplay song sounds kinda like mine."" It was an argument made by another band, about the exact same song.

Are you talking about the Coldplay accusation?
The original one hit wonder
"We didn‚Äôt charge anyone.  He can‚Äôt forbid us playing his song, specially if the avenue is public for anyone to play"
"There are a limited number of melodies though. Note combinations aren't infinite. There is bound to be some overlap across cultures and genres, and coincidentally so. Weird to think that a random person in a random place owns a melody because they played it in a song, as though no one else across the world and across generations could also have thought of that same note combination. It's a ridiculous argument to say that a melody is copied just because it's the same as one of millions of other songs. Has anyone even heard of this guy outside of his local area? The odds that Adele has even heard of him is probably zero."
"If we follow that logic, then Blondie should have sued The Killers for Mr Brightside, and Dua Lipa‚Äôs entire discography needs to be removed from streaming. There are only so many melodies, and songwriters are going to come up with the same ones independently. Almost every famous song shares a melody with another song."
"Some themes and melodies are so timeless and standard that everyone has used them. You can't copyright a chord progression.

"It is a 1-for-1 rip of the melody. No one said it's a ""carbon copy"". They said the melody is the same. Cat Stevens initially accused Coldplay of lifting the rhythm from his song. Again not a carbon copy, and not the same thing as Satriani's accusation. Cat Stevens never accused Satriani of stealing anything. It sounds like you don't actually know the facts of the case or what is being argued. Would they have settled if he didn't have a case at all? No fight to defend their artistic integrity?"
"He can't forbid you but you do technically need to pay for a performance license, doesn't matter if it was a free performance. Often venues pay that license for the musicians performing there"
"But the venue would pay royalties to him for the public performance of his work. Just because you didn‚Äôt do it, doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen. All these venues pay license fees to various organisations and file reports etc to facilitate it."
"Adele didn't composed this song, she only wrote the lyrics and sung it. The composer himself, which is not Adele, is a huge fan of brazilian music. He has even learned to play native brazilian instruments. As someone that studies brazilian music there's no way Greg didn't knew of this song."
">Note combinations aren't infinite.

The possible combinations are so large in number they might as well be infinite to us."
Excellent links - thank you.
"The composer of the song is a big fan of, and studies, brazilian music, to the point he has learned how to play an exotic native brazilian instrument. There's no way he didn't knew of this really popular brazilian song, and as such, any similarities are not coincidences."
Not all countries have the same law about it
"Oh, he can forbid it.  You might be able to get away with free use but only if you bought the sheet music."
That‚Äôs a good assumption. I don‚Äôt know the answer but still an assumption.
Go write a hit melody entirely in the Locrian and report back. The entire set of melodic combinations in that mode are effectively unused.
"Alternate news site: https://www.wesh.com/article/mom-speaks-out-after-son-was-hit-by-a-drone-at-orlandos-holiday-show/63258505

Video obtained by WESH 2 News shows drones zipping through the air before several collided and crashed into the crowd.

The Orlando Fire Department said one person was injured during the event and sent to a hospital. 

Adriana Edgerton said the person injured was her 7-year-old son Alezander.

She said her son is undergoing open-heart surgery after being hit in the chest by the drone.

Edgerton said that her family was watching the drone show when multiple drones fell from the sky, and one hit her son. 

""Everyone‚Äôs natural instinct was to duck and scatter, and before we realized it, my daughter found my son on the floor unconscious. He had blood coming out of his face,"" Edgerton said.

The boy underwent hours of open-heart surgery Sunday after the drone struck his chest with such force that it damaged one of his heart valves, Edgerton said.

‚ÄúThe blade cut his mouth, but there‚Äôs an actual imprint of the drone on his chest,‚Äù she said.

A spokesperson from the FAA released a statement saying the agency will investigate ""after several small drones collided and fell into a crowd during a holiday drone show over Lake Eola in Orlando, Florida.""

According to the FAA, ""Drone arrays and light shows are subject to FAA regulation. Typically, these events require a waiver to the regulation that prohibits operating more than one drone at a time. We thoroughly review each drone show application to make sure the flying public and people on the ground will be safe.""

Edgerton said more safety precautions need to be put in place for large-scale events in Orlando.

""This should not have happened, and no family should be going through this. We were trying to watch a show and have a good time,"" said Edgerton.

The drone show was organized by Sky Elements, a Texas-based company that performs events nationwide.

In a statement, Sky Elements said, ‚ÄúSky Elements Drones wants to extend our sincere hope for a full and speedy recovery for those impacted at our Lake Eola show.‚Äù The company added that it remains committed to upholding the highest safety standards.

The city of Orlando also released a statement, saying, ‚ÄúOur thoughts are with the family and all those impacted by the outcome of this event. The city remains in contact with the vendor and the FAA, who will conduct a thorough investigation.‚Äù

It is not yet clear what caused the drones to collide. The FAA‚Äôs investigation is ongoing.

WESH 2 News will provide updates as more information becomes available."
Saw a few clips of this and these things are full speed barreling down large distances. Sad situation all around and shows you that technology is definitely not perfect
"It seems like having a drone swarm over the crowd is a bad idea, because if things go wrong, the drones fall on the crowd. While it can be hard to control where people stand, fenced-off areas and bodies of water are ideal candidates for situating the drones over."
I saw a tiktok of the drones falling and one speeding towards the camera... uhhhhhh
"Now when Sky Elements goes to Skinwalker Ranch, they can't trot out the ol' ""We've been doing this for x many years and have only ever had this happen at Skinwalker Ranch!"" routine."
"I have always called drones ""Flying Lawnmowers""


Don't fly them near people"
"""Sky Elements Drones wants to extend our sincere hope for a full and speedy recovery to those impacted ""...

Yeah, kid was impacted.

But they aren't trying to play it down. Yeah, it sucks, and they have to do what they can, and so far it appears they will at least try."
‚ÄúHurt by drone‚Äù does really convey that he went into cardiac arrest in the field multiple times.
"I wonder what actually happened because rules 1 and 2 when you first get a drone are: 
1. Don't fly over people, and
2. Don't fly over streets, parked cars, traffic, etc."
Drones are a natural for Disney shows but this incident highlights why the lawyers won‚Äôt let Disney move forward unless the drones don‚Äôt fly over the crowd.¬†
"I haven't seen any drone shows, but the video of this one looks... sloppy and haphazard? There's so many drones not in position and it doesn't look particularly impressive. Not to mention the randoms diving at the crowd.


Is this representative of the state of drone shows?"
"Any updates on the kid? I hope the family gets a good payout to cover life long medical expenses, pain/suffering, counseling, missed work, etc.¬†"
I guess drones aren‚Äôt all that much safer than fireworks after all‚Ä¶
"Normally drone pilots aren't allowed to fly over crowds. 

Unless they got an FAA waiver, this show was illegal from the start."
"I've been hit by cardboard scraps from a fireworks show. It wasn't a big deal. But we have centuries of experience with fireworks and safety, but there are still accidents occasionally. 

it seems like we should maybe take these drones a little more seriously, not deploy them anywhere we can think of just because we can."
"I would have thought the same basic safety of fireworks, no one directly underneath them, would have still applied to drones. You know, the giant chunks of flying metal and blades. 

Kinda surprising it doesn‚Äôt."
"My dad's been talking about this for a few days, it's not often your home town makes the front page"
This will be a daily occurrence within 20 years
"I can‚Äôt open the article for some reason, so maybe it explains this‚Ä¶.but my cheap drone even has an autoland feature. It‚Äôs crazy good. High wings, hitting stuff, no matter what it will correct and land safely. Low on battery? It knows to head down and land.

The safety feature in even cheap drones are pretty good. Curious to know what went wrong here."
Doesn‚Äôt look like China
"I wonder what kind of controller they were using, as I don't think betaflight would cause a drone to accelerate out of control like that"
I thought drone shows were over empty ground??   I can't believe they were standing right beneath the swarm
"Is this a normal thing to worry about for drone shows? That multiple can just fall out of the air with no warning?

If this was in NJ, I would almost wonder if it was unintentionally in the crosshairs or general radius of anti drone technology that was probably deployed against the ""drones that nobody owns."""
"Damn, I was hoping this wasn‚Äôt a show by Sky Elements. Saw them on AGT. Good guys.  
This is a tragic accident, for the boy and his family especially, of course."
Drones‚Ä¶ so hot right now
"I've read conflicting articles stating the boy has preexisting conditions from negligence and the mother has even been charged before. From her social media posts it seems she's just after money and doesn't seem to care about her son.

Fuck the drone company and the city here but I'm only concerned about the kid."
Are those drones made in the U.S.?
the drones need to go
Civilian drones should absolutely be banned. They serve no actual purpose other than filming b roll for YouTubers and apparently colliding into children at high speed.
"It's confusing.. he was hit in the face by a runaway drone (yikes) and got cut up, but.. what did that do to his heart?"
"> Sky Elements Drones wants to extend our sincere hope for a full and speedy recovery for those impacted at our Lake Eola show.‚Äù The company added that it remains committed to upholding the highest safety standards.


Was there supposed to be an apology somewhere in there?"
"I understand there are FAA regulations around this stuff. And I also understand that sometimes shit happens and things go wrong. 

But I *thought* some of the regulation prohibited drones from flying directly over people? That having some sort of exclusion zone underneath the drones and then a little wider seems like it would go a long way towards mitigating the risk. Are drone shows excempt from that ""no over people"" rule?"
"Sky Elements? They were on the latest season of America‚Äôs Got Talent. Their drone shows were interesting, but their roll in the competition felt more like advertisements for their company."
The company should be paying out for all hospital costs plus extra to the family.
"I couldn‚Äôt finish reading this.

Thanks for sharing."
Probably still safer than fireworks
"You‚Äôre not allowed to fly them over crowds, there is a mandated exclusion zone. But flying objects can fall at odd trajectories."
"True, but looking at the video, some of those were zooming off sideways on a trajectory. Just planning for downward gravity might not have been enough. They need to treat fake drone fireworks like real fireworks: watched from a distance."
They were over water
The show was taking place over a large lake.
Up until the kids medical bills bankrupt them.
"""impacted"" is funny because they mean to use it as a weasel work instead of ""injured"" ""hurt"" ""victim"" etc. however in this case it is descriptive of what their drone did to the kid."
"Not trying to play it down? They couldn't even say the word ""Sorry""."
"The final amended rule carved out some exceptions, and they were operating under a waiver, so who knows what that waiver said.

IIRC the exceptions mostly pertain to drones under 250g, and to being able to fly over ""participants."" I think that means that if you're shooting a movie with an actor's permission you can fly a drone overhead."
"The show was taking place over a large lake. That said, I‚Äôm not sure if they staged the drones next to the lake, or if they flew in from a nearby field."
The video showed that they all weren‚Äôt just ‚Äúfalling‚Äù but shooting off in random directions
They probably got special permission to do the show but still wildly dangerous to fly them over people especially so many at once.
It was a terrible plan from the jump. They didn‚Äôt account for something going wrong.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKVrFWZG5TE

What it'd look like if nothing went wrong with the drones. There are many more video.

I think something unexpected happened, a bird maybe? There were many swans in the area and I could see 2 of them swimming by quickly in the accident video. It is possible an unseen swan flew up interror and knocked with a drone, sparking chain reaction."
"Not sure why anyone would think they were. Less pollution sure, but safer?"
"The show was away from the main audience of people, across the lake. For some reason, some of the drones malfunctioned and fell into the lake. The one that hit the boy went haywire and came across the lake into where the audience was standing."
FAA doesn't deal with China. This happened in USA
"> accelerate out of control 

They plummeted to the ground like the turkeys on WKRP.  Acceleration was caused by gravity, not software"
"I've been part of drones shows where I was shooting fireworks, and yes, I have seen them just fail and fall out of the sky, or collide with other drones. Thing is, they just fell down into the designated safety radius they were flying over. 

I've never seen them launch at the crowd as the usual failure mode is to just quit moving."
"Falling out of the sky is best case scenario.

They go full throttle at the wrong angle and you have a blade missile. Says it hit the kid so hard in the chest it left an impression.."
Video in the article says that several of the drones collided first. So it seems like just incompetence from the company controlling them.
What so the drone actually didn't hit him in the chest?
Post a source
"These were commercial drones being operated by a company. But you can‚Äôt be bogged down by things like the information in the article, you‚Äôre a free spirit."
"No other purpose? Not surveying or anything like that? Exploration. Conservation. Or in this case, replacing explosive fireworks.


I'd ban civilian guns long before civilian drones."
Bad take.
Seems like the main part of the drone hit his chest hard and damaged his heart valve.
"If you actually read the post you will be less confused, it hit him in the chest.

Literally fourth paragraph."
"It says in the article, the drone hit his chest with enough force that it damaged a heart valve."
"Drones are a lot larger and 7 year olds are a lot smaller than you think. The body of the drone hit his chest while the blades, which sit higher, hit his face. When the body of the drone hit his chest it damaged part of his heart which is why he needed the surgery."
"main impact was to the chest, but the rotors cut his face.  Problem was it was a couple pound hard object slamming with speed into a child's chest."
Blunt force trauma to his chest damaged his heart.
"No. The first thing their lawyers told them was to not say the word ""sorry"", or issue any kind of apology. It basically admits fault.¬†"
"‚ÄúImpacted‚Äù was a very poor word choice. That will come up in court, I guarantee it."
They better pay the medical bill
The response was written by a drone.
My first thought...
‚ÄúThoughts a prayers.‚Äù
"You can fly over people as long as you are transiting over them. Hovering is different. 

If you're going to hover, there are a couple of different rules depending on how much impact force the drone will make it falls out of the sky. I'm guessing these light show drones aren't massive and probably fall into the lower impact category. Basically they need to be deemed worth aircraft and they should have prop guards on them to reduce blade damage if there is an impact."
Pretty sure they were also on Great Christmas Light Fight as well
Wdym? I‚Äôm sure health insurance has it covered.¬†
"I started reading the initial incident and was utterly shocked this could be allowed to happen. It would seem to me you'd want them geofenced and if they fall outside, the rotors are shut off, or something. I don't know how big they were.


At the time ""boy was unconscious and in critical condition"" was where the reporting left off, holy nightmare fuel, those poor kids.¬†


I kinda don't blame kids for wanting to stay inside the house and watch stuff online.¬†"
It's not very long.
~9700 injuries and 8 deaths from fireworks in 2023 alone.
"That‚Äôs what nobody here seems to be addressing.

Drone array shows are a replacement for fireworks shows, which have caused countless injuries and wildfires in addition to tons of needless pollution."
Did you see the video? Drones went crazy
This case sounds to to the casual observer that one drone may have failed and collided with another one.  The failed drone probably just fell to the ground as one would expect if a blade failed etc.  however the other may have not been damaged but knocked out of sync with the show and continued on some preprogrammed path maybe flying into the boy.   There may have been multiple static drones since there are so many there could have been multiple collisions.  Additional safety protocols could include auto kill operations or a mode where the drone maintains level flight and slowly descends when it detects it is outside of a preset boundary.
Who ‚Äúmandates‚Äù said exclusion zone?
Is it identified or unidentified flying objects?
"Drones on the water

A fire in the sky

Edit: 0-3-5"
I wonder who has lower award caps? Texas or Florida?
"They didn't admit it about any specific person. Their lawyer can say ""that was a general statement, we never admitted this specific person's injuries were cause by *our* drone."""
"Legally speaking, no. Saying sorry admits fault and basically invites an immediate lawsuit."
"As shitty as it is, saying sorry admits fault. Their lawyers wouldn‚Äôt be doing their job well if they did."
"There was a platform (like a dock) where they launched from. 

Source: i was there"
Taking off from a dock and doing the show over a lake is about as safe as they can plan for. This was obviously an accident but unless they just didn‚Äôt do the show at all there is always a slight risk with anything just like a fireworks show. This actually seems like a very good plan to me. I get in my car and drive and don‚Äôt plan for things to go wrong but every once in a while there are car crashes or tires that blow out. You can rest assured the FAA will scrutinize this big time though because they view drones the same as manned aircraft almost. For instance if you shoot one out of the air it‚Äôs similar in the eyes of the FAA as shooting a helicopter or plane. They do not mess around when stuff is in their airspace.
Fireworks are an explosive fire hazard with pollution as a secondary concern. Drones arguably are less of a fire hazard but here we see that they aren‚Äôt much less of a general safety hazard
"Wild that it went that far then. Interesting. 

I wonder if the FAA will investigate it like a flight crash, or another org, since FAA investigations are usually pretty thorough and will implement new rules based on what went wrong."
"Oh, I must have missed that. I don't know much about drones, i just figured these formation ones were running on AI or something and had sensors to prevent that."
If you look up some articles I'm seeing conflicting reports. I've no clue. I just hope he recovers. Just an awful situation.
They are still civilian drones without a real purpose.
Well that's rude.  The posting was a CNN video that explained none of that.  Text came later.
"Damn that sucks.. must have been a really hard hit, or a larger/heavier drone than it looks.

That whole scene looks like a dystopian movie stunt."
"Yeah it was the boy‚Äôs fault for being in the way of a falling drone. 

/s"
"I may be wrong, but wasn‚Äôt there a big thing in Canada where saying, ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù wasn‚Äôt seen as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I / We caused this,‚Äù but more, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.‚Äù  

Like, your classmate comes in and says their dog passed from old age, naturally every days they‚Äôre sorry for the loss. It is not implied that the whole class secretly worked together to kill the dog."
"Ontario, Canada passed an ‚ÄúApology Act‚Äù back in 2009. I feel like we could use something like that in the states, though I don‚Äôt know how useful it has been for them."
This is one place where Canadians get it right. Saying sorry is not an admission of guilt.
"Unless you‚Äôre in Canada(I know these guys aren‚Äôt). Most of Canada is covered by some form of the act. In Ontario we have the Ontario apology act, 2009. Because we just say sorry for basically everything be it our fault or not."
This is the right answer. Good advice too if you are ever in a car accident. Saying sorry will absolutely be used by insurance companies to insinuate fault.
"I'm NAL but I don't think it matters here. The line that determines whether the claimant would receive tort is drawn through some action which causes an event which directly causes damage.

It's not really worth anyone's time to argue over whether the drone came from the drone ahow or perhaps just a random 3rd party drone that crashed; the arguments will be made on whether established guidelines were followed prior to and/or during the crash of the drone.

So in this case, though it's definitely not the language I'd encourage a client to use publicly, it's not too bad.

Mind you, if I were a lawyer, I'd tell my clients to say nothing at all, public or private."
It was heart-pounding
Aren't massive?  They put an imprint into a 7 year old's chest and damaged his heart.   Obviously it was massive enough to cause serious damage to a kid.
I wasn't aware of the transiting. Thank you.
"A geofence where the rotors stop isn't going to do anything to stop a drone already moving at speed. The momentum will just carry it beyond the established boundaries.¬†


Likewise, shutting the rotors off creates other issues since they're no just going to drop out of the sky.¬†


Typically, when a drone has some kind of malfunction or is going out of bounds, it's supposed to be programmed to either return ""home"" or land safely. This drone was probably behaving as if it were working correctly¬†"
"If you watch this video. One of them fucking launches at the crowd. 

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/us/orlando-holiday-drone-show-ends-with-technical-difficulties-systems-falling-from-the-sky/index.html"
"Most of them fell down, but if you see the video it actually does seem like a few veered out of control! It's hard to tell because it's dark, but there was something EXTREMELY weird going on. They didn't seem to just fall straight down. They were flying at people.

Horrible."
"At professional shows? Can't really compare a professional drone show, and professional fireworks, and then lump in all the at home accidents."
"Fireworks are a *little* more popular than drones, mind."
Large properly regulated properly setup fireworks shows pose no threat to the general public. Those setting them up may be in danger but entire shows have gone up at once and when properly distanced they just explode. This show turned a drone into a missile. Drones are by far more likely to cause injury to the crowd than a licensed approved fireworks show because fireworks can only explode so much. Drones can cover 200 ft in 2 seconds like they did in this case.
"What's to address really? Fireworks are dangerous and so is their replacement. Drones are *less* dangerous sure, but they still hospitalized a kid from across a lake."
"Yea they didn't 'just fall', they accelerated away from where they should be."
"Surprised it doesn't happen more often.¬†


Just need some type of jammer and it's game over"
I watched the video. It didn‚Äôt show the accident.
Link it
"Early drone shows had animators in blender dragging vertices around to represent the drones and make sure the vertexes never overlapped( collision). I think there is better software now, but there is still a lot of room for human error. 

Like the article says, drone shows tend to be done under special waivers so the FAA doesn't have a lot of specific regulations yet. Hopefully they come up with a way it can be done with reliable safety."
"I think one got turned into a missile on collision. 
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/us/orlando-holiday-drone-show-ends-with-technical-difficulties-systems-falling-from-the-sky/index.html"
"There were swans in the nearby lake, other video showed them swimming along while reporter were showing ground damage from the falling drones. And in the drone video, you could see a couple swans moving along quickly.

I think it may have been a bird strike that sent one flying out of control and collided with a few more, starting chain reaction.   FAA will know more when they are done ripping the company a new one."
"The FAA requires a waiver to do these shows and getting a waiver usually is conditional on meeting certain precautions specific to the show/location. That said, it's clear they may not be good enough."
The FAA as the other commenter said
"You say this like people don't know that's what is going on and that makes this situation ok. It's not. Fuck the lawyer and fuck the careless company. A small child needed OPEN HEART SURGERY. We can still call them out for being sleezy in their response even if they're ""doing their job""."
">Wild that it went that far

If you've met messed with drones much it's really not. If something goes wrong with the controller or something they go fast and far. 

I once had one bug out on me and do a massive arc out of a park. Diced bombed into a backyard nearby bounced back around and did another arc and dive bombed into the street in front of the house. Luckily nobody was home. 

With how common these shows have become it's kinda surprising this isn't happening more."
Im not seeing any of those articles
"There are so many civilian use cases for drones, including wildlife conservation, agricultural, and emergency response. I believe your argument pertains specifically for entertainment purposes though, which I can understand. But even then, there are legitimate uses for drones in the entertainment industry.

These drone shows specifically are more environmentally friendly than traditional fireworks shows, especially in drier climates that might be more susceptible to wildfires. 

Once the FAA completes its investigation we can move forward with solutions for preventing another incident like this. Without going into specifics and cost analysis, a netting system would seem an easy and effective solution, but again, I don‚Äôt know what the associated costs would be. And perhaps a regulation on the size and number of drones for these types of events. 

I was really surprised by the amount of injuries that little boy sustained, one news source likening it to being hit by a car. I don‚Äôt think I understood the size, mass, and speed of these things. There will definitely be changes as a result of this and I truly hope the boy pulls through and has a full recovery."
"Entertainment. Entertainment is their purpose.

Sorry man, being a social stunted Redditor doesn't mean you get to decide that entertainment doesn't count as a ""real"" purpose."
"Well thank you for explaining, I apologize for coming off as rude.

Merry Christmas, and I hope you have a great end of the year"
You agree to the TOS by just being there and them not liable for injury and death is in there probably!
His mom took him there so it‚Äôs her fault.
"Sadly, his health insurance won‚Äôt cover the medical expenses as he should have ducked faster."
"""Kid shouldn't have been trying to steal the drone"" /s"
"Cananda, sure.

in the US lawyers attempt to use sorry as an admission of fault"
"Well, unless it was their Akita, Evita. Then all bets are off."
"I worked at a retailer in the US for a while and one of the first things in the training was that, if a customer gets injured, we need to avoid the word ‚Äúsorry‚Äù because it implies fault. This was in the training videos, so I assume it was taught company-wide."
It was a real hit!
"NAL, but proceeds to provide legal analysis. Nice."
"Yeah - the FAA is pretty relaxed. They generally leave things open and only create rules when necessary. Their goal isn't too eliminate risk, but to make sure that pilots are taking the necessary precautions to mitigate risk for moderately risky situations. And that risk assessment is often left up to pilot discretion.

Flying is an inherently risky activity. As an example, if they were about zero risk, they wouldn't allow flying airplanes over cities like they do, but they're willing to accept that level of risk to facilitate the aviation industry."
"If it loses just one part, or loses power to just one part, it throws off the balance. So if most but not all of the moving parts are still moving normally, it's going to continue to fly, just not in the direction you want."
Holy crap.
I wouldn't put it past someone to have used gps jamming thinking it would be a funny prank.
"To be fair, even if you throw in amateur drones you're not going to match the mortality rate of fireworks.¬†"
"Sure, but drone shows don't give every person with severe enough PTSD in a multi mile radius an anxiety attack. 

My boyfriend has to go camping and use noise cancelling headphones for several days before and after the 4th of July. Unfortunately for him that's hardly the only time fireworks are used in a major city. Oh look the local theme park is celebrating its 50th anniversary, let's set off fireworks at 10pm for 50 consecutive days to celebrate! Oh the local football team scored or won let's blow up a few tons of fireworks! Etc etc. I see drone shows as harm reduction in general, even if the immediate area safety isn't as good. Especially since everyone at a drone show at least consented to be there. Maybe not informed consent, yet, but at least it isn't giving every vet in a 5 mile radius flashbacks while they hide in their basement playing music to try and drown out the noise."
To a certain degree you can still regulate drone shows to prevent this. Somebody somewhere didn‚Äôt think of trajectories of the drones and potential exclusion zones needed for that. Pretty bad oversight by the FAA and stupid of the experts who design the shows to not predict this.
"Figured I covered that with ‚Äúpollution,‚Äù but hey it‚Äôs bears repeating."
"Risk reduction is a thing, and we‚Äôre talking about an order of magnitude (at least) less risk.

If somebody was negligent, they absolutely should face legal and financial penalty, but if you want to live in a world that is totally without risk rather than merely much safer, you can stay at home instead of seeing shit fly through the air."
"If they take building and programming these seriously, it could ruin a show, but they should be able to just descend slowly on their own. If you overengineered them the way we do with planes, they should be safe."
"No, but it showed that they did more than just stop functioning and fall from the sky. An increasing portion of the drones stopped following whatever program they were on and started zooming around in all directions, including toward the ground."
Check the video that you‚Äôre commenting on.
">so the FAA doesn't have a lot of specific regulations yet

Not for the rich apparently. If you're just a regular hobbyist, they have plenty: all drones over 250g registered, transponder on drone, operator has to constantly broadcast location, must get drone loicense, etc."
"They‚Äôre just pointing out this is typical, calm down. If companies not immediately admitting fault when they fuck something up or get caught doing shitty things works you up so much you‚Äôd probably have a meltdown if you looked into just about any of the companies who produce your normal house products."
"Holy shit relax, it's a press release. You seem more upset about the response than the accident"
"> Fuck the lawyer

One of the annoying things is that they might have to be sued in order for the insurance company to pay out the medical bills. But at least on the surface so far they learned from McDonalds that trying to blame the victim is not a winning strategy.

> fuck the careless company

On the surface, an accident doesn't make them careless, even when a small child requires OPEN HEART SURGERY. Being careless makes them careless. So if it was a known fault that it could happen and they still flew, that might be careless. Even if drones occasionally fail, if they always fall straight down away from people, failure would be okay. But this sounds like a freak accident to me, given only the information in the article."
"We don't even know it was the companies fault.  Could've been that they were sold defective drones, someone could've been acting maliciously,  etc.  You don't admit fault."
"I was informing someone who didn‚Äôt understand that, clearly. Increase your emotional intelligence, or you‚Äôll only hurt things with your involvement. Shame on you."
"Cheers, and Merry Christmas!

Keep an eggnog close and the drones at a bit of distance."
To accuse them of not reading I guess.
"The TOS scroll was the first thing the drones formed.  When you read that and stayed, you implicitly agreed."
"That works the least it ever works in stuff like this. There is actually a very low expectation of injury, the ability for people to get injured relies almost entirely on the improper operation of the drones and improper cordoning of the event space. There was a case about a snow activity I think that ruled If the way people get hurt is by your gross negligence or recklessnes a TOS/waiver can't be used to legally allow such gross negligence. I don't see how anyone could reasonably argue the drone show has any real reason to keep such a tight space between the show and the patrons. However I could also see the gov catching a suit here, the place this was held does not look suitable at all for this event. The drone that got yeeted barely traveled to launch into the crowd. The visibility of the show is barely impacted even if you back it up hundreds of feet but this is a tiny area."
"Well it‚Äôs a US based company while the event happened in Canada, so there might be some leeway. 

I wonder if the US did use the word ‚Äúsorry‚Äù then would Canadian lawyers respect their local reading / ruling or attempt to use the American standard to step around it."
It really tugged at your heart strings.
"That makes some sense, thank you for explaining."
I've seen enough clips of drones in Russia and Ukraine to disagree with this lol
Sorry the world doesn't cater itself to your wishes.  PTSD and anxiety can be triggered by any number of things.  We aren't going to start padding the world because of it
You already named the localized solution to this problem. Fireworks are generally predictable occasions and earplugs work. Your request is to end something millions look forward to over the inconvenience of earplugs. Like yea it sucks to go through but your logic just doesn't work in a society at large because every activity harms somebody. You can downplay how much joy fireworks bring to people but the math doesn't work out in the favor of ban them. Also it sounds like your BF should try Ketamine therapy.
"Drones have a flight time in minutes. Fireworks have seconds. So if the issue is drones leaving where they are supposed to be, then they can hit something miles away from where they started, minutes later. 

Containing the two to a safety radius isn't the same."
"As another comment said, there may have been a drone from the crowd, not from the show, that caused the collision."
"Over engineered, like planes... Boeing would like a word. Also go to a local airfield without an FBO and check out the planes. You would be surprised."
Bacardi and cola. Do it.
Link it
"The pilot operating those drones still had to go through the commercial drone license process. It is just that in order to do a drone show they had to submit extra documentation to the FAA describing how they were going to prevent incidents like what happened. There isn't yet a regulation yet that outlines the specific operating conditions under which a drone show can occur, so its done through waivers."
People reads TOS???
"100% they will say ‚Äúthe FAA approved the county/sheriffs plan for crowd viewing. We operated our drones per contract, they were negligent for not allowing a proper buffer‚Äù defense"
"It says it happened in orlando. Is there an orlando cananda im missing?

Or am i misreading something"
"We'd say more, but we don't want to drone on and on."
Well I wouldn't say those are *accidents....* lol
They have some pretty big fireworks over there too
I‚Äôm pretty sure those are fireworks with drones attached to them
"Yeah as someone with a close friend who can't enjoy fireworks because he did multiple combat tours in Iraq I struggle to get behind this sentiment. He once said ""fireworks mimic warfare, and anyone who has been to war doesn't need to recreate it at home."" and that has stuck with me."
You can watch their drone formation break apart and hit their own drone which turns into a missile into the crowd. It wasn't an outside drone.
"Flying is extremely safe. There are loads of redundancies and rigid regulations. Boeing went off the rails for a while, that's true, but that doesn't really dispute the numbers. I'm talking about a commercial operation here. That's what a drone show should be. That's why I'm not really concerned about what people are flying at the small local airfield. It's not a fair comparison to something putting many lives at risk. I'm cobbling together a drone right now. It's not safe or very well put together, but I'm not going to fly hundreds of them near a crowd of people. That's a fairer comparison."
More of a Zelda fan.
Link it real good
"""Read"" vs read"
"The FAA is also to blame. Under normal flight rules, pilots aren't allowed to fly drones above crowds, however they make exceptions for police obviously, and for some reason this light shows. 

So tell me if this makes sense to you: for commercial purposes, without getting waivers from everyone in the crowd, I can't fly a drone over any crowd. Or vehicles.

But if a dazzling light show is involved, then of course, by all means, fly right over those people. 

Or if it's used for the police for purposes of ""safety"" then go ahead, fly right on over as many people as you need to. 

The FAA should have never made any exceptions to this rule, for obvious reasons. It seems that they did though, and if they did issue a waiver, allowing the light show to go on directly over head, I don't see why you shouldn't sue them."

"And we as a society can find new ways to enjoy things that aren't harmful to those around us. Just because we can doesn't mean we should. It makes it sound like you feel recreational explosives are more important than public safety and veterans mental health.

Also for your information he would never ask someone not to exercise their freedom because he has empathy and dignity. Sorry you don't think that deserves mutual respect.

If we as a community can't support those with disabilities amongst us we aren't much a fucking community. You're coming off ridiculously callous towards a very vulnerable section of our population. Guess those losers in wheel chairs should figure out stairs too, huh?"

">The painted angels ‚Äî with round childlike faces and wings ‚Äî once were among the defining features of Old North Church when they were painted around 1730. But officials at the church, a seminal location of the Revolutionary War, painted over the angels in 1912 with thick coats of white paint, part of an austere renovation that restorationists are trying to reverse.

While I knew it had to be something like that, the headline and intro to the article, as written, sound like the start to something in the horror genre.

""...and then THEY awoke."""

There are no pictures so this didn't happen.
Has it always been called the Old North Church?  What was it called when it was first built?
I feel bad for William Dawes who was part of the group but not famous enough to have his legacy carried in the poem/lore

The New North Church?  Actually it was Christ Church.
"About a month before filing for bankruptcy last year, attorneys representing the interests of clergy sex abuse survivors allege the Diocese of Oakland transferred $106 million into a non-profit called the Oakland Parochial Fund that hadn‚Äôt been active for years.

The victims and their attorneys are slamming the transfer as a blatant attempt to shield the church‚Äôs assets in the ongoing bankruptcy case. The money, they say, should be available to victims as compensation for the abuse they endured by various East Bay priests, many of whom never faced jail time for their crimes.

‚ÄúI think any bankruptcy judge would recognize that you can‚Äôt take $100 million out of the debtor and then say, ‚Äòmy pockets are empty,‚Äô‚Äù said Rick Simons, an attorney representing alleged child sexual abuse victims currently suing the Diocese in state court. 

The revelation came out in a recent court filing objecting to the Bishop‚Äôs proposed reorganization plan, alleging the transfer is part of a broader effort to mislead abuse survivors, undervalue their civil claims, and hide funds that could go towards a potential settlement. Attorneys representing survivors recently filed a complaint with the court in an effort to force a reversal of the transfer. 

‚ÄúThe Supreme Court recently reminded us that only a debtor placing virtually all its assets on the table for its creditors is entitled to a release,‚Äù said Brent Weisenberg, an attorney representing the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy case, in an email to NBC Bay Area.  ‚ÄúThe Committee does not believe the Diocese has done so here.  Rather, under the recently filed Plan of Reorganization, the Diocese fails to use hundreds of millions of dollars of cash, investments, and real estate from which to pay survivors of sexual abuse.‚Äù

Corporate records show the Oakland Parochial Fund, created in 2014 by the Diocese, is under the direct control of Bishop Michael Barber. Its articles of incorporation state the fund was ‚Äúformed, and shall be operated, supervised or controlled by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Oakland.‚Äù

Records show the fund went dormant in 2017 and was listed as suspended by the California Secretary of State‚Äôs Office. Last year, however, a few months before the alleged $106 million transfer, the Diocese‚Äôs chief financial officer revived the fund. In their complaint to the court, attorneys representing survivors contend the fund had no cash or investments of any kind before the $106 million hit the non-profit‚Äôs books. 

It‚Äôs now drawing the ire of victim advocates with the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP).

‚ÄúIn other words, this ‚Äòfund‚Äô was nothing more than a corporate shell until shortly before the bankruptcy was filed,‚Äù the group said in an email to NBC Bay Area. ‚ÄúNow, that shell has $106 million in liquid assets that Bishop Barber claims is off limits to victims who have sued the Diocese.‚Äù"
Remove charity status from religions that do this.
The Catholic Church is hiding something?!?! What?!?!
This kind of thing drove me from the church. Archdiocese of Wilmington declared bankruptcy before paying any victims. Then I was in mass at Church and they had a ‚Äúspecial appeal ‚Äú video from the Archbishop to re-fund the church.  We got up and walked out. Have not been back since. All of this shows it is not about serving people but holding onto power
It‚Äôs like the Bible said ‚Äúblessed are those that hide 108 million dollars from sexual abuse victims settlement funds.‚Äù
Pretty sure hiding assets before declaring bankruptcy is a crime. Some idea of the fraction of assets would be nice though. Presumably 106 million is a decent fraction of what the Diocese was sitting on though.
"Weird, they transfer priests the same way."
They did the same thing in Minnesota.
Nobody rapes and steals like religious moralists

"That Michael Barber is quite the asshole:

> In 2019, Barber opposed the proposed California State Senate Bill 360, which would have required priests to break the seal of confession and report sexual abuse of minors. He was quoted ""I will go to jail before I will obey this attack on our religious freedom.""

"Reminds me of that time I put an article in a local newsletter about a catholic priest in our area who was convicted in their following location for molesting kids. Because, you know, the local folks kids were near that creep before they left. My thanks for letting catholic parents know they should maybe talk to their kids? Me and everyone and everything associated with that newsletter was aggressively attacked and the parents demanded I be fired after offering a public apology. It was a news article from a reputable newspaper in Australia. Apparently sharing that info is ‚Äúanti catholic‚Äù and I am going to hell. I grew up catholic, and am in fact fairly anti catholic as a result, but now I'm VERY anti catholic because fuck people who think the crime was talking about a LITERAL crime against children possibly involving THEIR children. We did in fact apologize, but we got WAY more responses from the retraction and apology basically saying ‚Äúwhat the fuck was that problem with this article,‚Äù than we got initial complaints. Fuck religion in general and fuck that one in particular. Merry Christmas indeed‚Ä¶"
"Such a Christian thing to do. As is piddling kids and all the other shit they've covered up. Why do they have no tax status? Oh ya, because apparently the politicians have been doing the same thing since history began. :(

How you can tell when your church is really just another business.
"It's so telling how they're never afraid of God in these situations.  The calculation they're making is that losing money by giving it to the people they abused is worse than the wrath of God.  Why?  Because they don't believe gods are real, it's all just a business to them.  But if they, *of all people*, don't actually believe God is real, why should anyone else?"
Wow no way the church is actually evil shitbags who could have seen that coming?

"Wonder if *His Excellency, The Most Reverend, Bishop Michael Charles Barber*, believes Jesus would approve of his actions to hide $106 million from child sex abuse victims of the church.  

Stuff like this is just another in a long list of reasons why religion is a scam. If this super high up religious person actually believed in what he and the church preaches, then he would be racing to help make amends to this victims of his religion. 

Instead, it's about money. Ironically something Jesus preached against. Matthew 6:24"

Fresno Diocese just did the same thing earlier in the year.
‚ÄúIt was just resting in my account!‚Äù
I do hope they manage to shield their assets and get away with this abuse *again* - for what else can break the spell of indoctrination than the flagrant evil of religion being laid bare?
This is one of the reasons I gave up my faith. The Bible was translated by the Catholic Church for hundreds of years before literacy became more common. They controlled the narrative that their followers believed. Christians believe that the Bible has been preserved without error by the same organization that covers up child sex abuse by their leadership. That‚Äôs just a level of faith I don‚Äôt have.
"Wow man, $106 million dollars? These churches *really are raping people...*"
"Catholics - Rape the children, hide the pedophiles and the monies behind Jesus Christ. Christianity, interpretation of a book Kings wrote any way you see fit."

I'm pretty sure that's *felony* status territory...

"kinda hard to do that when half the country embeds themselves in various forms of that religion. when an org as 'small' as scientology can get the feds to back down via direct threats, you think they'd even dare approach an org wide approach to the catholic church, which has 10x the resources and 1000x the public support? not hardly."

"Much like franchising, this is a clever legal fiction designed to protect the real bosses from accountability."
"This is 100% true. Catholic dioceses have done a terrible job protecting their parishes. Our local parish that was brand new raised $10m to build the church. They started by building a center and were like 80% of the way to the actual church building. They had no sexual assault issues - they‚Äôd been around for less than a decade, since the mandatory protections implemented in ~2003 that successfully have protected kids. Because of how they‚Äôd structured the fund with the diocese, they ended up losing it all in a sexual assault lawsuit. They have had to worship for two decades in a center because of nothing they did. They are finally starting fundraising again. I am all for justice for victims, but I‚Äôd like to see justice for those who have given to a specific purpose and have had that money basically stolen from them. Life in jail and flogging for the priests who do this seems more just than our current system."
The fuck they don't. I worked for a company who's business is assisting Catholic churches in taking donations.
"Bollocks they don‚Äôt.  Whilst less of them pass around the little plate for you to shove your grubby coins and notes into (Covid?), they absolutely still take donations, just in a more modern way.  I just googled, checked my own Parish church growing up, requesting donations on the front page. I randomly checked another Belfast church, requesting donations on the front page.  Why do you think the Catholic Church is not short of a bob or two?

EDIT: I checked literally the first Oakland Catholic Church that came up on my search, and they have a very comprehensive donations page: ‚ÄúIn-person donations may be dropped in any donation box at the Cathedral or in any collection basket during Mass.‚Äù"
"Tithing is explicitly a Protestant thing and is never a requirement, the commenter above doesn't know what they're talking about."
They're far more likely to stop donating because of reforms in the church.
Well if this is true they don't really understand much about Catholicism because you have to be contrite and actually desire to mend your ways for the confession to be effective.¬†
Maybe the multinational organization that has been known to shield assets from victims should have a certain amount frozen.

"I don‚Äôt mind people having imaginary friends, or even organised collective imaginary friend meet ups etc. Go nuts. But pay ya taxes."
I wish religion was eradicated from this planet
"There's a problem with just getting rid of religion. If we assume that all religions are completely made up, then that means people all over the world, without any kind of coordination or contact, created various religions, all on their own. It's not like a viral video where someone did it and everyone copied.

Putting aside all of the politics and organization, at their core religion is about making sense of the unknowable. Getting rid of religions won't get rid of the unknown. It won't get rid of the sense that there might be something beyond the limits of what we can see and touch.

If you get rid of all religions, then people will just reinvent religion again and we'll be back to square one. Or there actually *is* some supernatural deity out there who will definitely restart their religion. It's probably better to determine a more appropriate role for religion to play in society."
"education & safety need to be added to the list, which includes things like running hospitals and schools. But if the community comes to depend on their hospitals, what happens when they seek an abortion or other ""forbidden"" health care?

Make corporates have to comply as well (Hobby Lobby)."
"It also wouldn't really do anything because American catholics famously hate the Vatican and don't listen to it, even at the threat of excommunication."
A righteous one even
"Legal lobbying is a vastly different animal (and would include outright donations from the church entities to favored candidates). There is a distinction. The churches have influence through guilt and sermon today, but they (as an institution) cannot toss a couple hundred mil after their preferred candidate as of yet. They can only convince others to do so."
"Satan: More powerful than God, killed far fewer people in the Bible."
"I don't think that adequately explains American catholicism. The fuckers were ready to elect an antipope before the actual pope cracked down on it. Imo it has more to do with the political divide, especially since the pope also sacked a bunch of priests that were preaching against vaccines or compelling people to vote for Trump (or calling him an agent of Satan)."
"it's not explicitly a requirement, but catholic institutions love to guilt trip the fuck out of anyone who has so much as walked past one of their locales. i went to a catholic school, somehow they tracked me down and i'm constantly barraged with 'please give us money' under the guise of various causes or 'needs'. they don't ask for skills, they want cash."
Now this I can agree with it.

aside from the hypocrisy the friendships and good times you may have had in those activities plus the sense of community is not a total waste - not all Catholics (your friends and church community) are bad people, just the ones in charge

And dont sexually abuse people.
And don't expect me to play along.
"I mind. If people view the world through magical thinking, then they will make decisions based off rules that don't exist. Religion has and will be used to justify all sorts of horrible actions.

"Its a fundamental tenant of Christianity that stuff needs to be Rendered Unto Caesar.

But when I tell people my sky wizard talks back to me suddenly *I‚Äôm* the problem!
"If your sermon has any influence on the way people run their lives - sorry John, you're doing government work, and need to pay your fair share of things.  If your sermon has nothing to do with other people, then in my book, they can be tax free"
"> I don‚Äôt mind people having imaginary friends, or even organised collective imaginary friend meet ups etc. Go nuts. But pay ya taxes.

Religion is like dick. Play with it all you like, it's fun. But stop whipping it out in public and shoving it down the throats of children."
"Nah, the problem isn't having imaginary friends, it's that their imaginary friends commands them to not believe in scientific research, and when the majority of people have imaginary friends who tell them this, we stagger our progress as human beings......just for those people. There was a lovely graphic I saw a while back the documented this, where humanity's progress in medicine and science was stagnated because people still believed that hand washing was for idiots and crazy people and that you could cure diseases by bleeding people out.

You might think having an imaginary friend is harmless, but the only real difference between religious people and schizophrenics, is that we allow 1 of those groups to thrive and not the other because 1 group was mentally capable of convincing a majority of people to believe in their delusions as well....and if you've ever met anyone with schizophrenia, their imaginary friends are definitely not nice for the most part."

I don't know why you're getting downvoted for saying you made friends and had some good experiences related to the church. Some people are just bitter.
But they were a waste. You don‚Äôt see it that way because you still believe in god. But imagine you spent an hour a week worshipping Mr. Peanut and talking about all the ways Mr Peanut will reward you if you are a good person.

Church and churchgoers: Objection, that violates our right to private confessions!

Lawmakers: We want to increase the window to allow sex abuse victims more time to seek justice against their abusers.

Church and churchgoers: We're going to spend millions to lobby against that and similar laws!

"Except the Satanic Temple is, in many ways, more politically active than the religions it parodies. Religion has been interfering with politics and politics has been using religion and it's messed up both. The Satanic Temple is a protest against how religions are conducting themselves, which is totally fine. I want religion to stay out of politics and politics to stay out of religion entirely. That's the Satanic Temple's whole shtick. If religion sticks to its lane, then the Satanic Temple will have to abandon politics as well, or become the very thing it's protesting, keeping the doors open for other religions to do the same, leading us back to the current mess."
"I feel like the problem lies within humanity itself. People are going to seek power. Religion, politics, and business are three major areas where people do this. It gets worse when three are able to influence each other. Politicians start preaching from the pulpit. Businesses start giving money to political candidates in exchange for favors. Churches start trying to tell their congregations how to vote. I think one good step is to somehow force each group to just stay in their lane."
"I'm thinking way back further than that - like thousands and thousands of years. Assuming all religions are made up, then at some point there was a point where there was no religion. Then, somehow, all around the world, people developed a bunch of different religious practices. You're talking about a few religions trying to convert people from their existing religions. I'm talking about the birth of religion, itself.

I'm betting any religion that's made up started because people were trying to grapple with the unknown. We know a lot more than we used to, but we don't know everything. I would say that the conditions haven't really changed. If you get rid of religion worldwide, people will still be trying to grapple with the unknown and you'll find yourself up to your armpits in religion all over again. You won't have actually solved anything."

"Taxing reseller of lies is a good start.

Forcing the addition of disclaimers for all their customers that none of the messages are based on reality and nothing can be proven. Would be a nice second

Enabling people to sue the reseller of hope for damages (preferably a lot of it) when a prayer didn't work if the disclaimers are not signed off by the victims. Even then the contract should still be reviewed legally.

Increasing education budgets and especially focusing on critical thinking.

Making illegal the indoctrination of children (churches for adults only, civil lawsuits possible from children against their parents), with an added benefit to reduce exposure for potential kids to be raped by the cultists.

They guys who did it are definitely on the naughty list
I read that headline as someone turned on their Christmas lights and were arrested.
My desperate hope is that after 15 years of horrible war all sides just want a bit of peace.  Something like Lebanon.
Here come the barbarians
Round up the usual suspects.
Guess where Syria is heading?
Chechens??? There are chechens in Syria?
"HTS  has to be careful here. Get it wrong, and the resulting backlash could make the recent civil war look like a minor upset over spilt tea"
"> turned on their Christmas lights and were arrested

Yup. The headline was either written by a bot or was written in a foreign language and was translated by a bot. To anyone fluent in English, this headline is very weird and kinda confusing.


""set ablaze"", ""burnt down"", ""set on fire"", etc...there are plenty ways to say this without putting the word the ""light"" near the word ""Christmas tree""."
Not necessarily¬†
Yeah. Welcome to the downvotes brother. Many delulu people on this sub.
"Yes, there are fighters from throughout the caucuses."
"I get the impression there are Chechen mercenaries basically wherever there are wars. They've been sighted on both sides of the Ukraine war, there were Chechens in Afghanistan and I'm pretty sure some in Iraq fighting the US.

It's a region that has seen a lot of war and suffered for it."
Seems like they‚Äôve handled it well. The tree has already been restored and they continued to show solidarity with Christians.
We will see.
"Nah, this is a good use of the ‚¨áÔ∏è.  ""Syria's future bad"" is generic, mindless gloom - **so** obvious it adds nothing to the convo.  

This guy's take is extra braindead since the article has some (cautiously) encouraging signs.  
> Videos of the aftermath showed a religious figure from the governing HTS rebel group assuring crowds who had gathered in Suqaylabiyah that the tree would be repaired before the morning.   
The man then held up a cross in a show of solidarity, something Islamist conservatives would not normally do.

""I know what will happen"" either way, *that's* delulu (& arrogant af)."
Why are they still there if the war is over? Let alone burning Christmas trees?
If they keep that up it can actually be a really good change for Syria.
"Which is good, but this is still a problem. It shows that jihadi groups that don't want this tolerance will be putting pressure on Christians and any government that tolerates them.¬†"
"The potential is certainly there, I don‚Äôt deny it. But there is also the potential for Syria to be a shining star in the Middle East, for democracy and religious freedom to flourish, and for a new era of prosperity for all Syrians. In my experience, Syrians are very moderate people. There are some religious conservatives like with any people, but I think the religious extremists have an uphill battle against the Syrian people. Even if Syria turns into an Islamist country I see it being a moderate one. I think that‚Äôs the most likely outcome here. A very moderate Islamist country that really does protect religious and ethnic minorities. That‚Äôs at least how Al-Sharaa is striking me lately in his intent.¬†"
all this hot air that history doesn‚Äôt support. tell you what. let‚Äôs revisit this thread in a year.
"It's almost like ideologues & radicalized mercs don't make decisions like many of us normies.  
Violence is addictive for some.   
(Re Christmas trees: Christian minority vs Muslim zealots yadda yadda - happy Festivus)"
The Syrian civil war is not over.
The government was only one of many sides in the war.  It won't really end until the remaining factions agree to a lasting peace and create something stable.
We can hope but I'm not optimistic.
"Between Israel and Turkey I‚Äôm not so sure, but there‚Äôs a chance."
I wish folks were less delusional about any group that models itself on any version of islamic conservatism.
"I mean it'll likely go to shit.  
Duh.  
So obvious it's pointless to say every fkg article about Syria - esp when facts in the article itself aren't where the statement comes from.


\***ETA** Also, point stands: *nobody knows*. Syria (like Iran & Lebanon) had a thriving civil society, not that long ago.   
A good outcome here would be unprecedented - but that happens.  Israel's establishment was unprecedented.  A colony winning independence from the British Empire was unprecedented, til the US happened.  Ditto for constitutional republics at the time; history suggested all those would fail.  Black swan events, blah blah.    
So yes it's simplistic to just say FUTURE BAD. Likely ‚â† profound."
"I am not optimistic either, but I hope I am wrong, for the sake of these people."
No one is delusional. Civil war is possible. Islamist theocracy is possible. But so are lots of other things we would find more palatable. So far he is saying and doing the right things. I‚Äôm encouraged¬†
"look, i‚Äôm not being a naysayer or cynic because i enjoy it. i think syrians have suffered too much and id really like them to return to those glorious days of yore. it‚Äôs just that my fourth-hand experience reading about islamist rebels taking over anything at all has been that particular anything goes to shit. I don‚Äôt wish it on them, i expect it and it makes me sad, which makes me cynical."
i also hope i (or my kids) get to see the version of free and forward syria that my parents‚Äô generation did
"> i think syrians have suffered too much and id really like them to return to those glorious days

I think we're largely on the same page.  And I share a *lot* of skepticism about prospects in the region.  If you want to hear how I got in trouble 2003 at my job (Army) for trying to scream from the rooftops how ""regime change"" would be disastrous in Iraq's case, it's ok to DM me. So frustrating. It usually goes awfully. Also, I'm bitter b/c of volunteering a summer with an Israeli Palestinian peace group, years ago - the checkpoints, the (understandable but unhelpful) grudges, even the nightmare tapdance around chair, table, & leader locations because of power perceptions... I low-key lost hope. Helped steel me for this current catastrofuck. 

Upvoting here because reasonable, nuanced take.  
BUT in their desperation for ""unity"" I sure hope Syrians can ""other"" these interlopers like the Chechens here - Islamist or o/w. It's actually possible in this case among many.

Again seriously I get why odds are bad. But the l they're not nearly as bad as some in the region, esp since more sense of unity as a people, than Iraq (or many others) ever had. 

Anyhow thanks for clarifying, friend. Here's hoping for a black swan (while bracing for the usual).

TLDR"
"I hope that for you as well. It may happen. Definitely encouraging signs so far. I would love a secular democracy that protects all freedoms, including the freedom to practice the religion of your choice, including no religion. But I will settle for a mildly religious state if it at least means some freedoms.¬†"
"I would normally take the side of u/Glittering-Path-2824 on this one but I watched a video of this man and maybe I am just naive, but I really think he was basically done with Islamic extremism. Almost like it was a phase in his 20s that he is not particularly proud of. That all he wants now is for Syria to prosper.¬†

This dude did not sound like an Islamic extremist lol. ¬†Far from it. If he has extremism tendencies now he is playing some long con and hiding them. I just don‚Äôt see it.¬†

I think the guy is really trying to rebuild Syria for all Syrians and I‚Äôm here for it.¬†"
I think imma shut up now because that was a great take
"alright, at least i can hope"
Our current President and incoming President are both older than the guy who was President 23 years ago
jimmy's gonna outlive another one
My 75 yo father went into the hospital with a fever that wouldn‚Äôt break and end up passing away 5 days later with sepsis.  Fevers are no joke at this age.
How crazy would it be if he goes before Jimmy Carter
Dude had a QUADRUPLE bypass 20 years ago? ü´£
With every ex-president that passes jimmy gets 5 more years.
"For context Donald Trump, Sr is 66 days older than the 42nd president. Bill Clinton left office January 20, 2001. The price of a dozen eggs was 93¬¢ or $1.68 adjusted for inflation. The current price of eggs is above $3.00 in most parts of America."
Must be nice to have that good good healthcare
"Wow, I hope the AI doesn't reject his insurance claim."
Is that a common response for just a fever? That feels like ‚Äúspin‚Äù
Jimmy‚Äôs gonna outlive one more president after all?
Has anyone tried more cowbell?
UTI maybe is my guess. Candidae is going around too and that's nasty.
I got a fever and the only prescription is more cow bell!¬†
Sounds like he‚Äôs primed for a 2028 Presidential run
"Im no big Clinton fan but I went to see him at a speaking engagement once.  A lot of other local politicians spoke as well.  The contrast was mind blowing.  They all spoke first and they would get up there and drone on about the most boring shit, I was out of my freaking mind bored.  Finally Bill is called to the stage and he hops up there, struts across the stage, waving at certain people in the crowd, smiling, very at ease, started off joking around, pointed out about 15 people throughout the crowd and told a quick story about each one of them. The whole crowd kind of lit up as well.  Im not saying he was evil like Hitler but he did have a certain mesmerizing charm to him, even if you didnt tend to like him, much like I feel Hitler probably did."
Must be nice to have the best healthcare this country has to offer at your disposal
"Ok Bill, nows the time to spill the beans about the Epstein parties¬†"
Somebody get this man some cowbell.
Hospitalized for a fever‚Ä¶.must be nice to have good insurance
Does his insurance cover his hospital stay?
Has he tried more cowbell?
I hope he doesn‚Äôt die during a Trump presidency
"Dude people are really being downvoted for calling this sack of shit out for being a sack of shit. Clinton has done shitty things with the clinton foundation, been on epsteins island. Probably done way more shitty things than we know about ‚Äúbut trump‚Äù they‚Äôre on the same playing field of being sacks of shit."
Bill Clinton the guy who bombed a pharmaceutical factory which then cause the deaths of thousands of Sudanese people because they couldn‚Äôt get their medication? Hope the medicine he needs is out of stock.
His recent segment on CBS Sunday Morning was the first time I felt like I saw he was showing his age. Pulling for him.
"My fingers are crossed and I'm hoping for the best that no previous president dies before inauguration day. I don't want to hear the orange cretin going on about how ""healthy"" he is compared to all the other oldsters."
Pretty sure the only cure is more cowbell.
"well, I can't say I blame him"
Bill was known for getting 3 hours of sleep a day back in the day. It caught up with him badly¬†
"I bet Hilary chases his ass into hell, not opening up a market without her."
‚Ä¶and the only cure is more cowbell.
"I went on X and holy shit it was cruel and crazy. No thanks, dude, I don‚Äôt need that"
Have the doctors tried more cowbell?
"When I get a fever, even if I can‚Äôt stand, it‚Äôs my job to fight it. Let the presidents die. They should mortality like the rest of us."
"Nurses watch out, Bills hot again....."
Imagine giving any fucks about a guy that was a frequent flyer on the Epstein plane
Trying to dodge that Epstien list...
Does he have UnitedHealthcare or other insurance? For a fever‚Ä¶.
Someone get this man some cowbell!
Probably hitting on the nurses.
Also got a bad fever today. Wonder if he ate bad chorizo too
Is the only prescription more cowbell?
I‚Äôve always thought he did a great job giving speeches.
he should run for president in 2028
"oh no, anyways, he'll be fine, he has access to healthcare that millions in his own country does not."
Does more cowbell help?
Thanks for the media landscape Bill. Well deregulated you fuck.
I'd bet he couldn't shake Hilary this Christmas and this was the only way he could meet up with the hot nurse he's dating. :P
Every photo of him he looks like he‚Äôs on deaths door.  It‚Äôs like he died 10 years ago but his body hasn‚Äôt gotten the message.
He's just hoping this will blow over.
"> Jimmy Carter: October 1, 1924 (age 100 years)  
> Bill Clinton: August 19, 1946 (age 78 years)  
> George W Bush: July 6, 1946 (age 78 years)  
> Joe Biden: November 20, 1942 (age 82 years) 

So there is a very high chance that Trump will preside over the deaths of 2-3 Presidents in his next term and possibly 4. 

> Donald Trump: June 14, 1946 (age 78 years)  

Add on Trump and him being the oldest after Carter, there is a chance that 5 Presidents die in the next 4 years with JD Vance presiding over at least 1 of them."
2024 got one more on the list for us. Damn.
What a marvel of modern medicine from tax payer $$ so he may be treated for free.
"Even if I'm liberal, I still don't like him. A cheating jerk who also can't keep his hands off women just like the other politicians."
"Man, if he dies before Carter, I'm going to be shocked."
I sure hope his health insurance will cover this fever-- oh wait nevermind.
"Probably a pedo, definitely a sexual predator. Won't be missed"
The Andro is wearing off...
I miss having a president that isn‚Äôt past retirement age. Even Obama who was elected 16 years ago isn‚Äôt even 65 yet.
"Clinton, W Bush, and Trump were all born the same year (1946).  Biden was born four years earlier.  So aside from Obama we‚Äôve been stuck with leaders from born in this 4 year window since 1992, that‚Äôs 24 of the last 32 years.

I don‚Äôt care what your political views are, objectively and mathematically that sucks.

Edit: W not HW"
They should have you draw a clock during the presidential debates
Trumpy and Clinton were born the same year yet Clinton was elected in 1992.
"The incoming president was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971."
"And sadly, voters had the chance to vote for a younger candidate last election."
Wasn't Clinton one of the youngest Presidents when he was elected?
"I kinda hate this point. Trump, Bush 2, and Clinton were all born in the same summer in that order in consecutive months (June-Aug.) So yes he's ""older"" than Bush but only by about 3w. That's the blink of an eye in a lifetime. Clinton fell about 6w after Bush so all said, they were born in about 9w of each other.¬†


That said, Bush 2 and Clinton were also 20-30y younger when they were in office. Might've been born in the same year but certainly aging takes a mental toll and you have to remember this. I don't think any of us would be thrilled about either of them serving another term at this age, regardless of Trump's crimes.¬†"
Pretty sure Elon is only 53
What do you mean? Elon Musk is only 53 years old.
Clinton is only two months younger than Trump
Don't worry people will be making Obama memes long after both those fools are gone.

"Clinton looked and sounded old af at the dem national convention. Very unnerving since I hadn‚Äôt seen him since probably 2016 when he seemed fine. Age catches up fast at that age. 

Except for old Jimmy. Dude was too busy doing good to age at 4x speed during Trump‚Äôs presidency like everyone else did."
Jimmy Carter is too good to die.
Bill Clinton needs to live another 20 years to have been alive after his presidency as long as Carter is now
I genuinely think he will make it to 108 and achieve nirvana¬†
My 92 year old grandfather went into the hospital with a minor stomachache and never came home. Things can turn fast at that age. After a certain point they can't even safely treat a lot of things because the medicine is as bad or worse than the disease.
"I just learned today that UTI's can kill you quick through fever and sepsis, and now I'm reading about it everywhere."
My grandmother died this summer in about three days after contracting sepsis. I‚Äôve seen a couple comments saying ‚Äúall he has is a fever and they take him to the hospital‚Äù but I think it‚Äôs easy to underestimate how quickly sepsis can kill you.
Sorry for your loss.
The human body is a finely tuned machine as willing to destroy itself as protect itself.
"Holy shit, that‚Äôs horrible, I‚Äôm so sorry that happened"
"Same thing happened with my grandfather. He went in just feeling a little under the weather (fever, chills, but very much alert and chatty) and never came home. Sepsis. It was devastating. I lived with him and my grandma at the time and was so distraught I crawled into the hospital bed with him after he passed. I was 21 and he was like a father to me. The best papa."
"Hell I'm just standard middle aged and I had a fever that maxed out at 103 this summer. I was seriously considering wandering to the nearest ER but it broke and dropped down to 100 within a few hours. That shit still scared me because my husband was working late so I was alone and I was worried that if I fell asleep, I might not wake up."
"I really thought we were in for a presidential funeral at the start of 23. Two years later, here we are. I hope the guy is all right but yeah, Carter is on a roll here. Bush 1 had so many death scares before he finally went.¬†"
I was thinking the same thing.

We peaked as a society during the 90s. I genuinely believe that.
the way things are now came from decisions made then. bill clinton is one of the authors of our current time.
"NAFTA signaled the move for American manufacturing to Mexico, and policies pushed by Clinton emboldened banks to create the housing crisis.   He was a neocon and only a slight improvement from Bush"
"Dude created a balanced budget and left office with a budget surplus.

I mean...he also deregulated a bunch of industries and signed NAFTA which fucked over American manufacturing, among other catastrophic things, but ""the economy"" was great there for a brief window!"

Inflation is a gamed number. Take anything you actually need and it has risen higher than inflation. Gasoline maybe? Is one item that has been lower.. maybe subsidized stuff like crops and some meat?

"Met him in person once. I was the president of a YDC in rural Arkansas. He spoke like he knew me, talked about backroad (like down a few dirt roads) party spots - I was a teenager and he was asking if people still used them. Then switched it up to the history of the area, real out-of-the-way stuff you have to dig and look for to know about. We spoke for less than five minutes and I felt like I'd known him for a while because he was so at ease and put me at ease too."
Was looking for this! I second that request
He could probably just pay out of pocket lmao.
"Trump would never stop gloating. 

He seems to have forgotten that he invited the Clintons to his and his third wife‚Äôs wedding."

I miss having presidents that actually worked out and took care of themselves.
"What‚Äôs funny is we haven‚Äôt had (and possibly won‚Äôt ever have) a president born in the 50s, despite being the most populous decade of births, and that group turned eligible during 1985-1994.

Now, the youngest candidate from the 50s would be 69 in 2028, and if elected would be one of the oldest presidents."
People were seemingly on the same page about that when the Biden vs Trump debate happened then suddenly Kamala became the candidate offering people exactly what they were asking for in a younger non clown show candidate and suddenly everyone was falling in line with Trump again ü§î
That‚Äôs all but ten years of my life. Even my parents were born in 1956‚Ä¶
"I really hate presidential debates with a fierce and fiery passion. They're so fucking meaningless and irrelevant to being president. President's don't do fucking debates. They're just media controlled events for soundbites.

I think they should be asked to present a plan to improve one aspect of America they think is needing it. Then they each get 20 minutes of nationalized TV time to present their plans in detail. At the end, their asked follow up questions.

This let's us see what they intend to do, how they intend to do, and compare the candidates based on solid plans rather than empty talk they won't bother with.

No plans? Fuck off the ballot then."
"Born the same year.

One will have a term just 2 years from the 1980s, the other will have a term just two years from the 2030s. Pretty wild."
And trump was saying down the hall and to the left
"Apparently living through the covid recession in one of the better countries that handled it meant we need to have a Trump induced tariff tax hike, recession, and possible end to democracy."
One of. I believe JFK was the youngest president elected and Teddy Roosevelt youngest president in general (became president after killing of McKinnley)
Only 13 if you factor in emotional maturity.
"Clinton already served 8 years in the white house over 24 years ago, a different generation of kids were in school. He was elected 32 years ago at age 37, making nearly half his lifetime ago."
"It would be awesome if Jimmy called Trump into his hospice room to give him some 'presidential advice' and then just pulled out a glock. The fuck they gonna do to him? He's a hundred.

It's not going to happen, but it would be cool."
I didn't even recognize him for a second when I tuned in.
Bill Clinton had a lifetime of poor dietary choices. It was even subject to criticism during his presidency.
"Clinton has lived longer than any other male relative in his entire family line.  He‚Äôs talked about this.  

If he wasn‚Äôt president he would have died long ago from heart attack or some other treatable condition.   

Because he was president he received the best care and had people around him help him make better dietary choices.  

I hope he keeps on keeping on."
People like bill need a constant supply of pussy. They fall apart without it. Hillary obviously nixed that. Similar thing happened to tiger woods
His wife was basically publicly humiliated by losing to Trump and he had to watch 'gestures to everything'. Surprised he isn't dust by now.
He looks like a corpse.  Death would feel better especially with his wife gone.
The grim reaper has tallied how many fried sandwiches Bill's eaten and deducted days off accordingly
"Great-grandmother had a heart attack at 93, didn‚Äôt seem to phase her since she was still behaving like a cute little old lady when we visited her immediately after. She gets shipped off to another facility and shipped back to the hospital after like a week, can‚Äôt remember. She didn‚Äôt go home after that due to total organ failure if I recall correctly. It‚Äôs been about 22 years now and I still miss my great-grandma."
"Dude!  You have to go pick him back up, you can‚Äôt just leave him there.  

His bill has to be astronomical by now."
I knew an old lady who went in for knee surgery and died from a stomach bleed. Their bodies are basically held together by Aspercreme and spite for life trying to sundown them.
Holy shit. I went down a weird wiki rabbit hole yesterday that ended up at actress Tanya Roberts‚Äô page. She died of sepsis from a UTI at aged 71.
"I lost a dear friend this way, she was in her early thirties. I couldn‚Äôt believe it."
thats what got midge!
"I have been in the ICU with sepsis from a UTI. A doctor told my wife that I had a 50% chance of dying.

I got better.

Then I got sepsis twice over the next few years.

I still got better.

Don‚Äôt get sepis!"
Tanya Roberts passed away exactly like that
My grandmother in her late 80's got a UTI and it immediately kicked off rapid onset dementia. She's still with us but man it was some whiplash and how she's sadly barely functional¬†
"My then-81 y/o grandma ended up in the hospital for three weeks because of a UTI. My brother lives with her and got home from work to find her unresponsive on the floor. Everybody thought she had a stroke and they kept doing tons of tests and imaging assuming it was a stroke. I live 500 miles away and by the time we got there, they had figured it out, put her on IV antibiotics and she was at least able to talk. She had all the classic dementia symptoms as if she was completely mentally gone. Then was fine two days later. 

She had physical therapy and home health nurses checking on her for a month until one called an ambulance because her heart rate was super high because she apparently had covid. She was fine the night before, but hadn‚Äôt gotten out of bed yet in the morning. The home health nurse almost immediately called an ambulance. 

UTIs are no joke."
Guess the good ones don't die young after all
"It's always the unhealthy, hateful old bags who will outlive us."
The fact that your profile pic is Colonel Sanders is the cherry on top of this comment.
"The national debt is always interesting to me, for the last few decades the deficit has always increased under Republicans and decreased under Democrat presidents, at least until COVID screwed everything up."
"Well the stock market was rising because he ended all oversight of loans and banking. His policies caused the worst recession since the great depression. 

Free money flooded the economy, problem is there was no such thing as free money. So when it came due to pay, it crashed everything."
The 90s started and ended with recessions.
Rush talked so Ben/Joe/Jordan could yap.
"The irony is that our Congress is so geriatric, that there are sitting members of Congress who impeached Clinton for lying, but looked the other way when Trump lied 100x times more and voted to dismiss his impeachment. 


All of them need to die or retire, preferably the latter. They enabled this horseshit."
"I‚Äôm no fan of the current president. But Clinton perjured himself by lying about having sex with a 22 year old White House employee while he was president. He lied about this under oath as part of a lawsuit against him for sexual harassment from when he was a governor, where it was alleged he had the state police escort a state employee to his hotel room where he exposed himself and propositioned her. Pretty bad if you ask me.."
"Yeah Bill Clinton was a big part of the shift to neo-liberalism after Reagan walloped the Democrats. They went running to wallstreet elites for decades after. Bill was nicknamed ""Blue Reagan"" for his policies."
"Nostalgia. I'd argue that many of the Clinton era policies that were put into place actually ended up destroying more lives than anything Trump has ever done and Trump is/was a shitty president.

Mandatory minimums sentencing, three strikes and you're out, don't ask don't tell, draconian child support laws, and his failure to capture Osama Bin Laden all ended up with many people in prison or dead."
"We really did. Some of the best video games came out between 2000-2010, but aside from that, pretty much everything else was better in the 90's. It was very funny when the first teasers for The Matrix Resurrections came out, because we'd all be Cypher now. ""Just put me back in a pod, I'm tired of reality."""
Yeah Bosnians and Rwandans don't feel that 90s nostalgia.
"It's the time where world peace seems to be finally here (ignoring a few wars in third world countries) due to the end of Cold war and the formation of European union, and tons of technological advancement (Internet, medicine, space)."
"China as well. We lost so much major manufacturing and technological edges for short term profit gains.

Not to mention turning the Midwest into the rust belt destroyed so many lives and made the place ripe for exploitation in the form of the Opioid crisis."
That'll do it! If you can't see the prices you don't have to pay em!
Not to mention corporate greed. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egg-suppliers-ordered-to-pay-17-7-million/

Technology is general I think has been lower.
And has had heart issues.
This is exactly how my father passed October.  High fever that just wouldn‚Äôt break and died 5 days later.  This can happen rapidly despite all the jokes being posted to ‚Äújust a fever‚Äù.
How does fever lead to sepsis?
He looked and sounded terrible when he spoke at Detroit.
Merry Christmas üéÅ
"Really, a persistent fever of unknown origin in an elderly person? It's not that weird.¬†"
You seem to forget they were best buds on Epstein Island.
I thought he looked his age at the DNC 8 years ago.
Always talking about BlueSky but never Threads.  Threads is a much bigger app. Why not Threads?
Im a liberal so nice try. Clinton is known to have been on Epstein flights but keep on supporting him
"It's no lie, the travel on Epstein's Lolita express. What I would like to know, how did democrats suppress this information during the election"
They both are bro holy shit anything not trump gets downvoted Thats hilarious as fuck.
Way to keep your head in tbe sand.  Bill was definitely an Epstein fan.
Both of them.
"5th youngest. Teddy Roosevelt, JFK, Bill Clinton, and Ulysses S. Grant were all younger when ranking age at the start of each‚Äôs presidency."
"If I'm reading wikipedia correctly, you can sort by ""age at start of presidency"", and Obama is 5th youngest [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_presidents\_of\_the\_United\_States\_by\_age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age) , Teddy R, JFK, Clinton, and US Grant all younger (some big names there)."
"I remember how his ""inexperience"" was a concern. Funny how that sentiment has changed"
Roosevelt was the youngest at 42 I believe.
"Obama was fifth youngest.

Teddy Roosevelt, JFK, Bill Clinton, Grant, Obama.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age"
"Obama's inexperienced really showed in how he dealt with Republicans though. For all the political momentum he had going into his term, he politically face planted pretty hard on the individual mandate. All the support he had going in evaporated with that stupid requirement on the ACA and gave so much fuel to the fire against it."
Biden is very active for his age.
Don‚Äôt want to drain that battery.
"Similarly we never had a Vietnam vet serve as president. Every guy who lost a presidential election in the 2000's was a vietnam vet though. Gore, Kerry, and McCain."
Reminder: Biden was the first (and hopefully only) Silent Generation president
"Because if Americans are anything more than ageists, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre sexist and racist"
"A return to old-school debates would be cool. Instead of rapid fire questions and back and forth discussion, each side has time allotted for long-form statements and rebuttals. It would be boring, though, so it'll never happen."
"I like seeing how someone behaves under pressure, before I give them the nuke codes.

A debate is one of the few unscripted situations we will ever see them in."
Best we get is a concept of a plan.
"What gets me about the debates is how popular they are in America. It also seems like such a big deal in the scheme of things (Biden literally dropped out of the election because of one). 

I only in the past few months learned we have pre election debates in Australia too. I‚Äôm keep myself pretty up to date with our politics especially during election cycles but somehow I have just missed them and any news about them for like 15 years. Even then the only reason I learnt is because my friend worked at the venue where it was hosted. I feel like I could have gone my whole life not hearing about our election debates if that hadn‚Äôt happened."
"Well, when you put it like that..."
dont worry were just gonna go to war with canada and mexico and annex greenland. no big deal. what could go wrong. /s
"For funsies, ask a trump supporter who was in office when the country was shut down and you couldn't buy toilet paper."
Can confirm.  I was in elementary school when Clinton was elected President.  I have a white beard and arthritis now.
37yo at inauguration? That can‚Äôt be right
"I'd prefer for him to launch up out of bed and attack trump like a viper, turn it into Bob Barker in Happy Gilmore"
The peanut farmer becomes a lead farmer
"Very ghost. -150 charisma. (Clinton at DNC)

I do wish him and the people that love him the very best."
Trump eats like shit. I'm waiting for his dietary choices to catch up with him. üçîüçü
"For those not alive then or otherwise not in the know, what choices and what criticisms?

Hamburgers? (Daily?)

Clinton‚Äôs turned around the ship - and maybe overshot - with a vegan diet (hope he still got some source of vitamins, maybe via B12 injections?), after cardiac surgery/stents(?) in 2010."
He went vegan like 15 years ago.
His wife was publicly humiliated when her husband got caught with Monica Lewinsky‚Äôs mouth around his willy.
I'm surprised he didn't die when Trump got elected. He said he was hanging on just to vote against Trump.
"It's always so strange to see people go so quick but especially at that age I would hope I wouldn't hold on too long.

I know sometimes it's too fast but after seeing my grandparents and great aunt all die in hospice in the same house, I am a firm advocate of transferring patients who are certainly terminal back home for their final moments. My grandfather especially was miserable- he had his second major stroke and was put in a nursing home and hated it, he wanted to go home and be with his wife in the house they had lived in for 55 years. He got his wish after he fell out of bed and went from someone on the mend to on death's door. Unfortunately this isn't feasible for your typical person, hospice care can certainly be resource intensive."
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.   She sounds like a special person and I am glad you had a wonderful great grandmother.
The people who commit fully to believing in humanity (Carter) and the people who commit fully to destroying humanity (Kissinger) seem to live forever. Maybe it's just the lack of conflicting thought that propels them.
The congealed fat is the only thing holding them together.
"I find it strange that, (if I have my history right) Reagan caused the deficit to explode, it continued under Bush and is one of the reasons Bush lost re election. Clinton made it a mission to fix the deficit and succeeded. Then Bush Jr made the deficit explode again. Now we just act like the deficit and national debt is some insurmountable problem. We can just balance the budget, it's not easy but it's doable and we're just not."
Grifters gonna grift
Who is more fiscally responsible: tax-and-spend Democrats or tax-cut-and-spend Republicans?
"Oh that's an intentional tactic, and it's called the [Two Santa Clause Theory](https://www.salon.com/2018/02/12/thom-hartmann-how-the-gop-used-a-two-santa-clauses-tactic-to-con-america-for-nearly-40-years_partner/).

TLDNR version:

Democrats win elections by giving stuff to people. They're the santa claus party. So Republicans bitch about it constantly and then when in power spend like drunken sailors, making their friends rich and throwing a little bone to the plebs becoming the second santa claus party. Eventually the debt grows so big that the Democrats will \*have\* to cut their santa claus programs like social security and medicaid/medicare. And when they do that, they will never be elected again."
"Trump is a POS, but it's absolutely insane to look back at Bill's precidency or former ones as if policies and deregulation back from the 80s and 90s didn't cause a fuck load of the issues we face today.

Can't believe people say shit like that seemingly earnestly."
Huge irony being that's exactly Trump's plan. Isn't he bringing musk in to help cut through red tape?
">Well the stock market was rising because he ended all oversight of loans and banking. His policies caused the worst recession since the great depression.

Not really, even if you are talking about the repeal of Glass-Steagal that literally only happened in 1999 meaning it was in the seventh year of his eight year term."
"I agree with you, what he did was not befitting of any decent person, let alone the president. Would you agree that our standards have fallen mightily since then? Clinton's stuff seems like a Tuesday for Trump and co"

You realize that policy before was the military actively tried to hunt down homosexuals? Like the ideal is to allow open service, but DADT was better than what was happening before."
Gaming ironically has been one of the few things that has gotten better imo. I‚Äôd say some of the best have been within the last decade.
And has great health care
"I'm sorry for your loss.

Has a similar scare with my MIL who is in her 80s. Older folks can be pretty defiant about it being something benign, then the next thing you know they're immobile and needing to be rushed to the ER.

Now we have a strict ""Go to the doctor when you're sick!"" Rule."
"I‚Äôm sorry. My dad also died of sepsis at the similar age of 77. Sepsis posts trigger me a bit and I‚Äôm sure you as well. 

Best of luck though the holidays!"
Fever is one of the body's way of fighting infections.
"Well, indirectly.

Fever as a reaction to, but not the cause of, an infection or illness for even something as minor as a cold."
"Moreso fever is a sign of sepsis. To be septic, fever is part of that criteria. However, you‚Äôre right; fever itself doesn‚Äôt cause or lead to sepsis."
"A fever isn't usually the actual problem, but rather a symptom of the body fighting something off. Infection is the most common culprit, which is why if you go to the doctor for a fever, you'll usually come out with an antibiotic prescription to treat the underlying cause."
"I‚Äôm the first one to call this shit out but yeah, this isn‚Äôt really abnormal for a prolonged fever. It‚Äôs not a good sign though. Would be a slightly worse sign if he wasn‚Äôt an ex president though, obviously they do get some special treatment‚Ä¶ but fevers in old people are definitely a doctor thing."
Grant didn‚Äôt look like one of the youngest to be honest. Might be the full beard and the stress of fighting a hard war for years.
"Fun fact! Teddy was the youngest to take office, JFK was the youngest to be elected."
Almost like some of our best or most consequential  presidents were folks that weren‚Äôt being followed around by the grim reaper while in office
interesting to note that the vast majority of our presidents were under 60 when elected...would love for that to be the case again
"If you exclude Teddy Bear, Obama was the 4th youngest ELECTED president. Teddy first assumed office after McKinley‚Äôs untimely passing.¬†"
That's why [he let Citibank pick his entire cabinet](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/10/15/wiki-o15.html) - put experienced people in charge.
It's actually easy to see what will happen in the future by simply analyzing what is being critiqued today.
Wasn't it Joe Lieberman who made them drop the public option? It was wrecked by his own party.
That ‚Äústupid‚Äù requirement would have made healthcare significantly more affordable for all Americans.
"It's not a stupid mandate, it's the only way the whole thing works.  Without the individual mandate, the only people paying for insurance are the ones who are likely to have big medical bills, and the healthy just go without.  And then the system can't fund itself."
That's weird. Almost like Vietnam is a losing mark.
"It wasn't a debate but Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was shocking and memorable at the time simply due to its brevity.  

His speech lasted no more than two minutes. His 'opening act' went much more according to the standards of the time, and lasted two hours. The audience of course expected more of the same from Lincoln. 

Oratory was a highly regarded skill and means of entertainment, and brevity was not one of the precepts."
But then you have to watch one guy have a complete meltdown over his opponent making fun of his crowd sizes and live knowing that he's about to be handed the nuclear codes again.
Don't forget Panama!
We can just have trump sharpie in some new countries to annex first.
"> war with canada

Could they at least torch Maralago rather than DC this time?"
"You are correct, he was 46."
The standards don't apply to Republicans.
Proof that genetics is the end all be all
"Clinton's presidency saw him stress eating burgers and hotdogs every day. One of them, he had done a jog to a McDonalds to eat two sausage egg McMuffins. He gained some 30lbs in office, which prompted the criticisms. 

Another thing is his family has a severe history of heart issues. Eating an unhealthy diet then dealing with the presidency every day was literally killing him."
only after he had an immense cardiac emergency
He really wanted to vote for Kamala. I'm glad he lived past election day so he can say his vote counted (would've been nulled if he passed since he wouldn't have been alive on that day.)
He didn't say he wouldn't do it again
"For her I don‚Äôt think there was even time for that. My memory is fuzzy or I just wasn‚Äôt giving it my full attention at the time since I was 17 but I remember my mother saying she‚Äôd had a heart attack and was in the hospital. When we went to visit she seemed perfectly fine as if it didn‚Äôt even phase her (vividly remember something about her commenting how one of her nurses reminded her of Kobe Bryant, which in hindsight might have been kind of innocently/unintentionally racist) so they move her to a rehab facility, which apparently wasn‚Äôt the greatest, the family who ran it was known by my friend‚Äôs parents to be kind of shitty (I think) then a week or two later they were rushing her back to the hospital she‚Äôd been in and within a day or two she was gone. Cruddy thing is she wanted to see me graduate and was a year and a month short of it."
Good news for me as an arch Leninist.
Centrists losing as always
Clinton is the only president in my lifetime to have had not only a balanced budget but a budget surplus
Rose tinted glasses and the fact presidential policies often have impacts that aren't felt for decades after. Like Ronald fucking Reagan legitimately has a massive impact on today's world and his presidency was decades ago.
Probably because they were too young at the time to understand them. Or to hear the opposition opinions. I have family in the Midwest who loathe the Clinton's because he went back on his word with NAFTA. Now the US is struggling to build back up a manufacturing base and can't replace certain declining fields for critical to things such as Ship-building. Can't have free trade without enforcement like the US Navy.
Almost as if Trump and Clinton used to be friends and were a part of the same circles
"Trump has dementia, he doesn't have a plan. His handlers do."
"Happened to my grandpa in law as well. Went from a refusing to see a doctor over a slight fever to literally in a mentally frozen but awake state from the fever spiking quickly within hours. Once the ER got his temp down, he just snapped out of the frozen trance suddenly was confused why he was in a hospital. 

Exactly on that rule."
"Very much!  A pit in my stomach when I see them pop up in the grief support forum.  I hope you also have a wonderful holiday season and I‚Äôm sorry about your father, too."
"To clarify, you don't need a fever to be septic, but can be present."
Or just the fact that you saw him depicted as he was in his time. Look at what the average 40 year old looked like even 40 years ago versus today.
And the whiskey
Could also be that pesky being born in the 1800s disease
"I think that might be because photos we see are maybe usually from later in his Presidency (even non Presidents visibly age a lot between 46 and 54)

Looking at the photo the National Park Service put to accompany his first inauguration, he doesn't look that wrinkled, and his hair hasn't gone gray

https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/president-ulysses-s-grant-s-first-inaugural-address-march-4-1869.htm"
"For a second, I forgot that inaugurations used to take longer and I was trying to figure out how JFK aged faster"
Well one of those was just not for being old.
"Not American but do have an interest in your guys‚Äô history and politics. Most of my favourites seem to have been in their 50s (I‚Äôm a huge fan of FDR and Eleanor). 

I always figured that was a good age for high office. Old enough to have experience of how the world works. Young enough to have to deal with the consequences of your actions. 

And yknow, not be completely senile."
"That, and they were more connected to issues affecting working-age people instead of issues affecting people who will naturally die in less than ten years."
"Nah, I vote Burns!"
"Technically Lieberman was an independent by that point; he created the ""Connecticut for Lieberman"" party in 2006 after he lost the Democratic primary.  He also endorsed McCain in 2008."
And it almost happened if not for Lieberman and the tragedy of Ted Kennedy
that you can even more weirdly blame on World War II vets
Why doesn't he just sharpie Atlantis already?
"They can have all of Florida, honestly."
"Trump is in no way genetically superior. His arteries are surely caked with plaque, and one day, he will suffer the consequences."
It probably bought him a few extra years regardless.
">(would've been nulled if he passed since he wouldn't have been alive on that day.)

This varies by state, but actually isn't true for Georgia!

 [As long as you were alive](https://www.newsweek.com/jimmy-carter-georgia-absentee-ballot-vote-count-1970872) when you sent in your ballot, it will be counted regardless of whether you are still alive on election day."
I hope he lives longer to vote in 2028 lol who knows? He‚Äôs been very active volunteering for Habitat for Humanity which contributed to his longer lifespan.
"That was the same for my grandmother. She was the last to go and wanted see my twin brother and I graduate but missed it by about 11 months after falling and breaking her hip (also what took out my great aunt). She passed while I was off dealing with my ditzy, self-absorbed cousin who got into a wreck on the way over to my grandmother's house, which my cousin promptly made about herself, ""Grandmother died while *I* wasn't here! Why?!?"" That pissed me off at the time but now I look back at it with maybe a little smirk."
The American gerontocracy: One administration controlled by unelected handlers is replaced by another administration controlled by unelected handlers.
Abraham Lincoln aged tremendously during the war. He was only 56 when killed. When he was young he was known as a tremendous wrestler.
"One of the reasons people in old photographs look much older for their age is simply our idea about what looks young and what looks old, particularly with regards to clothing and hair.

Obviously advancements have been made with regards to health and longevity, and you can always find individual anecdotes. With this concept is largely a matter of perception, with a modern bias towards what an old person looks like."
"When someone accused Grant of being a drunkard to President Lincoln, Lincoln said he'd send a barrel of whatever Grant drank to Lincoln's other generals.  ""He fights!"""
"Nah, the whiskey and cigars are what kept him young."
And 4 long years of war.
"Teddy took over the office at the age of 42 after McKinley was assassinated, he was 45 when he was reelected. JFK was 44 when he was elected."
"In all fairness, the Reaper kept coming for Teddy too. The dude just kept refusing to die."
"a big reason I was excited for Kamala was I wanted a president who could answer the question ""how do you want to see this country in 10 years""(Preferably 20 but at this point I'll gladly take 10 I feel so sorry that Obama is likely going to see the country in the same shape if not worse than when he first became President 20 years later) it depresses me that Biden had to effectively waste half his presidency playing damage control for Trump and we're at the mercy of a bigoted rapist who just wants to fuck 90% of the country over for the 1%(most of which himself included will likely be gone in 10 years btw )because the media was salty their ratings were lower in 2021"
"it's really interesting you say that! When JFK was running for the highest office, he used that premise in his wildly popular political jingle. 'do you want man for president that's seasoned through and through? but not so doggone season that he wont try something new. A man who's old enough to know and young enough to do. well it's up to you, it's up to you it's strictly up to you, but it's Kennedy Kennedy or me'

  
....shit was from the late 50s but it is an ear worm that's for sure"
Boo-urns!
You're conflating the individual mandate with the public option
"He has been in hospice for over a year now.  I'm surprised he lasted this long.  

Also, I hate to say this, but I do hope he goes before the inauguration, so he gets the funeral he deserves."
Why did I read this in trump‚Äôs voice!? ü§£
A barrel of hard liquor is a pretty serious commitment to drunkenness.
"I read that and feel a bit of the shade. My ancestor was George McClellan, commander of the union army before Grant. He is known for having been fired by Lincoln for too cautious and not being aggressive enough.  üòÇ"
"To be fair, the bar was pretty damn low for Grant"
"I mean sort of, if you mean they killed him before he could get to the age Obama is now"
The whiskey and cigars were him self-medicating. Dude had crazy PTSD.
"Little known but back in the civil war they had to thin out his whisky ration with formaldehyde, Grant did not notice a difference in taste."
"""Death had to take him sleeping. For if Roosevelt had been awake, there would have been a fight."" - Vice President Thomas Marshall, 1919."
"‚ÄúFriends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible. I don‚Äôt know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.‚Äù

And he was right."
"I imagine Death hiding in the bushes and Teddy just walking by saying ""Not today"" and Death going ""aww......"""
I feel like that's what's going on with Jimmy. Either that or he refuses to die without taking Trump with him.
He was the OG Chuck Norris.
Sounds like a skill issue on JFK's part. Teddy beat death why couldn't he?
"And now the media is eating their own foot, since anyone left of 'believe everything you hear on Faux without a shred of awareness' has stopped watching the news. Because why the fuck would we subject ourselves to however many more years he lives of ""Trump says he's going to do X and here's all the laws that breaks. OMG, he did X, can you believe it? Nothing will happen to him as a result."""
You're right sorry
"Don't. Lincoln had some seriously badass reach due to him being lanky as all get out. Imagine Jim Carrey, but taller, bearded, and (barring Ace Ventura), knew how to wrestle. That's Lincoln.

I don't think he was as funny as Jim Carrey, but I could be wrong due to the fact I've never seen Abraham Lincoln do stand up or act in a movie. Homeboy might have been hilarious for all I know."

"When the Grim Reaper dies, Teddy Roosevelt comes for *him*."
That's where Chuck got the idea to try to swim through land.
JFK survived having his boat rammed by a Japanese sub and being stranded on an island in the pacific. He cheated death at least once already.
Lincoln was famously hilarious- he almost got kicked out of court as a lawyer for making his co-defense laugh too much. A lot of his energy left him when his son died.
"That‚Äôs a crazy thought. The benefit probably outweighed the costs by far. 


Can‚Äôt even imagine that kind of stress. It only takes a rough day and sciatica for me to want a glass of bourbon and a far more lame way to get nicotine."
The whiskey started way before that though. It‚Äôs more apt to say ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôve been drummed out of the army for being a drunk and are selling wood door to door in St. Louis the whiskey will keep you going.‚Äù
"Let‚Äôs not forget: when being told Grant was a drunk overly indulgent in whiskey, (which is debatable let‚Äôs be honest), Lincoln (reportedly) inquired as to what kind, and suggested sending crates of said whiskey to his other generals."
Death had to take a slapping via Teddy's big stick!
He was the macho badass Trump thinks he is.

"As someone in public health this is such a scary situation to be looming overhead. Because of certain messaging during the pandemic (and of course just mistrust from a then-minor group of people before that) we really set up swaths of people to distrust recommendations despite the overwhelming evidence in our favor. It also doesn't help that health literacy seems to be at an all time low even with people ""doing their research."" People aren't taught how to read an academic journal (and in some ways part of it is the language used and that's not necessarily their fault), people aren't taught to recognize the signs of a grift, they don't look at qualifications or they think someone's hard earned qualifications are useless (See the war on dietitians as of late).

"Don't forget about the 10,000 dogs they kill every year.

And I feel like the statistical likelihood of that many dogs being aggressive towards the police officer is pretty thin. Dogs just aren't that aggressive at that kind of rate. If they were, dogs wouldn't be allowed as pets."
That's not entirely fair. It's not JUST because he bankrolled his campaign. It's also because Trump has no interest in governing; he just wanted to stay out of jail.
"Police love fascists, they provide job security"
Yes. Tiny percent.
"This would work great if there were so many people applying to be police that many had to be turned away. The reality is most police forces, especially in big cities, are insanely short staffed. We as a society actually had a chance to show that we didn‚Äôt need a large police force. All we had to do was be decent to one another during this police shortage and cities would see they didn‚Äôt need so many police. But there are too many shitty people in society and the second they realize police are less likely to be around they start ignoring and openly breaking laws. 

Too many people only follow the law if they think there will be consequences for breaking it."
"There are exceptions to every rule, but approximately 85% of law enforcement voted Republican last month. It's nowhere close to balanced or diverse in thought."
"Police departments and the FBI are predominantly conservative. Are you seriously challenging that blatant truth? Well, for starters, only conservative Republicans have helmed the bureau and the Supreme Court of the United States has been conservative-controlled since the 1960s. That's just on the national level.

\**So, do you know any liberal-progressive cops, or not?*"
"Are they? Just because you don't fit the stereotypes doesn't mean that you're proof of the stereotype not mapping onto reality in some way, right? Can you provide evidence that most, or even half, of MFA graduates are conservative leaning, because that seems contrary to my life experience.

Also, I would bet that the FIELD of engineering would be a decent (i.e. will lead you to a correct answer >50% of the time) predictor of political leaning. For example, I would guess that network engineers are probably more liberal than conservative, and I would also guess that geological engineers are probably more likely to be conservative than liberal."

"Who are these democrats speaking out? I haven't seen them infact for the first time in about 25 years, I've seen both sides be pretty much on the same page. Are we living in different realities, or are you trying to push a specific narrative for a reason?"

Thanks for the laugh! You‚Äôre hilarious!
"Do you know any liberal-progressive cops? 

^(I recognize I was being demonstrably stereotypical, that was the point. It's that grossly comical of a unanimously conservative profession.)"
"Wouldn‚Äôt you think It‚Äôs doubly important to hold the people enforcing the law accountable for breaking it? Also, your use of the term ‚Äúrat out‚Äù paints the whistleblower in a negative light. 

I‚Äôm done with excuses for cops that are silent about corruption, it makes them complicit in anything that happens in their department. If it‚Äôs too ‚Äúhard‚Äù to hold your peers accountable, then you shouldn‚Äôt be a fucking cop in the first place. It‚Äôs not so difficult to enforce the law when it‚Äôs a homeless dude or a black person, or someone who shot a CEO, is it?"
"They have a duty to uphold the law. Or should, anyways. ""It's too difficult"" is hardly an excuse.

Why is there so much apologizing on behalf of the police in this thread?"
My guess is every breath all day long!
It seems we are living in different realities. Eric Adams called him guilty. Kathleen Hochul has used rather extreme language. The list is really too long to name and considering those folks aren't in your reality plus you are obviously trying to push some weird narrative it isn't worth my time.
Found another idiot. Luigi's attorney called out at least one of them by name.
"Oh my god, I'm talking about how you're stereotyping highschool kids like it's some sort of 90s sitcom and then ascribing a positive outcome to the group you obviously identified with in highschool."
"You are right about ‚Äúrat out‚Äù - I was going for what it likely feels like from the inside, not what the rest of us would see it as.  I did not convey that well enough.

I still find being the actual law breaker to be worse than being the person who fails to point it out.  Saying they are the same, or that failing to point it out is worse completely ignores the fact that there wouldn‚Äôt be anything to point out without the original act."
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too difficult‚Äù can easily mean any of the following

1.  The systems in place are the sort of things comcast does to keep you from canceling your service.  Designed specifically to frustrate you into giving up.  An institution can have a lot more perseverance for that than any individual.

2.  You have been shown, over and over, how utterly pointless it is when others do it.

3. Your career ends immediately.

4.  You die.

It‚Äôs not apologizing to recognize there are hurdles that keep it from being the obvious choice that it looks like from the outside.  It is despicable that getting away with it is the default and so very easy for cops.  The entire institution is and always has been corrupt as fuck, existing purely to protect the wealthy and powerful.

That does‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt nuance in the discussion about whistleblowing.  I‚Äôm sorry you conflated my nuance for an apology."
Ah yes the corrupt mayor of New York and the governor of New York. Surprising those two wouldn't be happy about a murder in their city.¬†
"Eric Adams and Hochul are a far cry from Democrats ""all over reddit.""

Edited to acknowledge that I misinterpreted what the previous commenter had said and misrepresented it in turn.

That said, given the context, the point I was attempting to make still stands: That the views of Eric Adams, Kathy Hochul, and other elected officials don't represent or reflect the views of the people."
Do you know any liberal-progressive cops?
"This feels more like you‚Äôre more interested in being pedantic. Can we put our critical thinking cap on and acknowledge that the only reason there are so many corrupt cops is because of the routine cover-ups that are performed? One issue feeds into the other. The whole system is garbage, I don‚Äôt care about the ‚Äúfew bad apples‚Äù angle anymore."
"Reading comprehension is tough for lots of folks, don't feel bad about it."
"Never mind, you're dense"
I comprehended what you had written just fine.  You used blatantly corrupt establishment lizard-people as your examples of Democrats speaking out against Luigi Mangione.  The commenter you were speaking with was talking about humans.
I'll take that as a no. Me either.
"No.  They caught it and admitted to it. But it was secondary to the actual point.  Which you have never addressed.

Do you know or even know of a single liberal cop?

There‚Äôs a reason for the stereotypes.  And the HS stereotypes are entirely beside the point being made here."
Lotta use of the word ‚Äúsynergy‚Äù in that article‚Ä¶
"Basically Honda and Nissan are hoping this merger can help them compete with China. China has moved heavy toward EV, and Honda and Nissan are severely lacking in that department. It seems they hope they can combine their R&D and maybe get on par or ahead of China or be able to compete. 

The problem with that is... IP theft. They are still manufacturing in China. Even if they got ahead, they'd lose it. Whatever progress is made would certainly be lost. The deck is heavily stacked in China's favor right now. Even if they pulled out of China, and was able to advance, it wouldn't take that much longer for China to still get ahead. Instead of having the documents and actual manufacturing processes in place, they could just get a car, and reverse engineer it. 

Overall, I don't think this merger will do what they seem to hope it will do."
Perhaps Honda shouldn‚Äôt have spent the last 15 years dragging their heels on ev and nissan shouldn‚Äôt have spent the last 20 years sucking out loud
Two auto companies with different culture trying to merge is not going to be easy.
I don't know man. Both of these have something none of the Chinese automakers have: a reputation for reliability and quality. They just need to put out some compelling EVs and most consumers would pick there cars over any Chinese ones. It can't be that hard surely!
"If Honda makes cars like Nissan makes cares I won't buy them any more.

I like my Honda, but if they make junk I will just buy another Toyota."
"In 1996 i bought a new Small Holden made by Opel in europe. It was a piece of junk but the dealership in Auckland Nz were Good People, Moyes.Even very good people! New driver seat wiper motor gearbox and few other things . Around 27% residual after 3 years. On to Toyota i wentü§ó


They also used to sell Nissan and had just stopped that franchise.


I also had 7 years in two Honda Accords before and after the holden.
Still like Civic and Crv.. but not turbo or cvt..."
"I‚Äôd love Nissan to be a retro and performance brand only. Recreate the old Datsun styles and GTRs. Get rid of their crappy Altima, etc."
I guess I just don‚Äôt understand how mixing two boring car companies is going to make one interesting one.
"> Even if they got ahead, they'd lose it.

Do they need to get ahead? Right now the concern is simply with catching up. I don't think it's realistic to think that they can or even want to be better than the Chinese EVs - they just want to compete.

Right now there are a lot of cheap EVs in China. Depending on who you ask, it's either because of their engineering prowess, government subsidies, lack of safety requirements, that they can't go faster than 60 km/h, or some combination of all four. None of the cheap EVs are available outside of China (at least, not without changes and not nearly as cheap), so that should at least tell you something.

EV platforms are fairly straightforward (in theory). It's a big battery and a motor. Add some thermal management systems to the battery pack (looking at you Nissan...) and you're basically 90% done. Innovation comes in (a) better motors; and (b) better batteries. Honda might innovate on (a), but I suspect neither company cares to put in the effort for (b) and will just use off-the-shelf batteries - probably from CATL in China.

If Nissan and Honda keep building vehicles targeting non-Chinese markets, they will probably do fine, even if China ends up stealing their designs. China has yet to make a huge impact on the EV market outside of China, partly due to tariffs, but also (I suspect) due to the fact that building a car that meets ""western"" safety and speed standards is expensive."
"IP theft? China is making their own EV IP because the government as a whole has pushed for EVs for a decade while western governments farted about it and arguably, still are shitting the bed. China is ridiculously electrified at this point, it's every other country that should be looking to steal EV IP from China LOL.

Shit, China's bus fleets now are over 60% all electric.

"The MG4 (roughly 50kwh battery) is available in Australia for A$31,000 or USD19,000, they are doing some runout sales. This is a driveaway price, which includes stamp duty, insurance, registration, etc. It achieves the maximum 5 star safety in ANCAP which is harmonized with the Euro NCAP safety regime."
">IP theft? 

Yes. They are extremely known for stealing IP and not giving a shit about it. 

>China is making their own EV IP

Two things can be true at the same time. They can make their own... while also stealing others. 

>because the government as a whole has pushed for EVs for a decade

And? That's great. It doesn't mean they haven't taken from other companies in the meantime. 

>China is ridiculously electrified at this point

Okay? I think they are headed in the right direction, but it doesn't mean they will suddenly change how they operate and stop stealing from other companies. 

You also can't take what they say as fact. They make very bold claims but in reality it's a lot less accurate. Their overall quality is improving, but it's still not on par. I think their battery tech will eventually overtake the rest of the world, their software side is really good, but their overall packaging is less than desired.  

Take for example the Xiami SU7. The brakes are a joke. They have a ""brembo"" casting that if you didn't know better would look like a 6 piston design with a full pad. Theirs, it's closer to a damn motorcycle pad. 

https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-14-135752.png

They like to make bold claims, but can't really back it up... yet. 

Again, I think they are headed in the right direction. But... thinking that they don't engage in IP theft is ridiculous."
"Not great I would imagine, considering BYD was just accused of using literal slaves for labor."
"The ncap Ratings are a curious interplay of many culture clashes coming together. In traditional car making, you make a safe car, and by correlation it turns out to rate good at the NCAP.


However, in China, they fully realized they didn't know what it took to build a safe car, so they used the test as a design guideline , with the best intentions. Those cars score good at those tests, obviously, because they care about that.


However, the funny thing is that they don't have a lot of experience with certain collision types, like low speed intersections etc... so those 5 star cars perform really all over the place in crash scenario's that are not explicitly covered in the NCAP. It's not all bad, it's almost random, but makes a great difference in costs related to repairing and therefore insuring those cars and the NCAP ratings lose a lot of their value"
"This. Car manufacturers spend millions in R&D just to produce decent stuff but then Chinese companies will just steal IPs and produce locally. Coupled with the Chinese government heavily subsidizing EV manufacturers, they are flooding the world with their cheaper cars."
Car reliability has little to do with manufacturing ethics sadly¬†
"NCAP has nothing to do with repair cost though? It's all about protecting lives. If your vehicle passes the 50kmph frontal crash and 60kmph side impact, why should you be concerned with a slower 30kmph frontal or 30kmph side impact? Is there some evidence they perform worse at 30kmph than 60kmph..."
"When I listened to Serial, it did seem sincere enough that I felt Syed was innocent. At the end of the last episode, though, I noticed something that made me skeptical: a piece of evidence came in that did not prove Syed innocent, and Koenig reacted with frustration. I get how it would make the podcast an amazing story itself, but it gave me pause. Since then, I‚Äôve read the counterarguments and think the evidence leans towards guilty. It‚Äôs all an extremely unfortunate situation, and my understanding is that he claims to simply not remember anything during the time Hae Min Lee was killed. I think Syed should be honest about what happened in that time."
"This is the podcast that got me into podcasts, need to check to see if serial is still around or if she has done any follow ups to the story."
I feel like one of the few people who listened to that entire season was like ‚Äúyeah he did it.‚Äù
"Except when reading the case files, you can see he did it, his friend admitted to helping hide the body. No one else had motive and means. If you read the case files and their correspondence, her diary entries, the timing of the day- it‚Äôs impossible it was anyone but him- they were obsessively in love and she started to date someone else."
"Serial S1 was extremely popular and gripping and also such a clear example of journalistic malpractice. ""Let's learn together"" is a good model for science documentaries, but it's not a good model for true crime (except for cold cases), even though there have been countless imitators since. I feel so bad for the family of Hae Min Lee. Serial left out almost every single piece of evidence that pointed to Syed as someone who was possessive, controlling and unable to let go of Hae Min Lee. It minimized the strength of the prosecution's case while maximizing irrelevant details in order to create the appearance of reasonable doubt.

Are there many wrongful convictions for serious crimes partly based on racist animus? Surely there are. But despite what Serial S1 leads one to believe, Syed's conviction was probably further beyond a reasonable doubt than the typical murder conviction! It's a shame that there are so many other cases in which actual innocence has been established, but this one is the one that kick-started the true crime podcast genre, and it's a case in which he almost certainly did it. More, Serial S1's puerile moral lesson of ""Can we ever really know or remember anything??"" only should seem deep to 15 year olds. It seemed deep to me then and I was a lot older than 15, but I've had years to reflect on it and reconsider.

If you listened to Serial S1, I encourage you to read some of the write-ups in /r/serialpodcast regarding what Serial S1 left out, and how all of the facts and evidence point towards it being *unreasonable* to believe Syed did not murder Hae Min Lee on January 13, 1999. There is also a two-part series of articles (written by someone I almost surely disagree with on nearly everything else) that compellingly points towards Syed's guilt: https://quillette.com/2023/05/22/the-wrongful-exoneration-of-adnan-syed-i/"
"When I heard Syed never tried to call her even once after she disappeared I thought ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs guilty‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure if he acted alone during or after the fact but I think he‚Äôs guilty."
"I forget who his friend was that turned on him, Jay? It always seemed weird that Adnan never seemed upset about his friend ‚Äúframing‚Äù him for murder. Which leads me to think that Jay has more on him and Adnan doesn‚Äôt want to confront him."
This is one ringtone‚Ä¶ told over a series of rings‚Ä¶ and the story it's telling you‚Ä¶ is that your phone is ringing.
I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúhes so guilty‚Äù camp
This guy is so guilty.
"I think Adnan is an absolutely perfect example of the difference in ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù and ‚Äúinnocent.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyway the dude is innocent. Not guilty is another conversation."
This man killed that woman and Serial tried to make it seem like he didn‚Äôt.
"Yeah, he killed her.

The podcast tried hard to be ambiguous and the fact is that both innocence or guilt leave bizarre details and loose ends in the story.

But, the fact is, either he killed her or he didn‚Äôt.. it really seems to me like the simplest explanation is, he did."
Was this article even walked by an editors desk? Basic spelling and grammar mistakes throughout.
"Can somebody who knows law explain how a conviction can be reinstated after being overturned? How is that not in violation of the constitutional right to not be charged for the same offense twice? He was initially convicted, then was let free, and now they're trying to re-imprison him for the same murder. Regardless of guilt, how is this not unconstitutional?"
This guy murdered a girl.
Def came away from the podcast thinking the right person was in prison. Tried watching the Adnan doc on HBO soon after and was just disgusted by it I stopped.
The podcast that explained to me why you don't talk to the police without a lawyer present.
"This is one case where I‚Äôm truly torn. I believe that it‚Äôs likely that AS is guilty but the evidence isn‚Äôt strong enough to convict without doubt. 

Also he served 20 years which isn‚Äôt an uncommon sentence in a case like this. At this point I think the best course of action is to convict AS of lesser charges and give him credit for time served."
Listen to The Prosecutors episodes on Syed and you‚Äôll have no doubt how guilty this guy is.
"My theory has always been that Adnan murdered Hae and planned out the murder prior, but Jay fucked up the original plan somehow. I think Adnan saw Jay as the ‚Äútown idiot‚Äù and scapegoat, which is why he recruited Jay to help him murder Hae. That‚Äôs why Adnan never seems to get mad at Jay for pointing the finger at him- because Jay probably knows even more than he‚Äôs said already, and Adnan doesn‚Äôt want to risk provoking Jay into saying more. 

I just don‚Äôt see who else would want to murder Hae. Nobody else had a motive. Meanwhile, Adnan was cheated on, embarrassed by, and dumped by Hae. Also, why purchase a brand new cell phone and lend it to your drug dealer along with your car‚Ä¶ then ask your ex for a ride home on the day of the murder?

At the end of the day, this case is tough because he seems too nice to commit murder, but it also seems obvious he committed murder, but there also isn‚Äôt enough to prove he did it beyond a reasonable doubt."
"This is just a small exert from the wikipedia article ""After¬†*Serial*¬†ended in 2014, there were discussions by the¬†[Innocence Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project)¬†about conducting¬†[DNA testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_testing)¬†of the physical evidence collected in 1999.[^(\[64\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hae_Min_Lee#cite_note-64)¬†Documents obtained by¬†[*The Baltimore Sun*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun)¬†in early 2019 show that Maryland prosecutors tested multiple items tied to the murder in mid-2018 and Syed's DNA did not match any of the DNA present"". 

also this ""On March 10, 2022, the Baltimore City State's Attorney signed on to a motion filed by Syed's defense attorney, Erica J. Suter, requesting that the court order new DNA testing on Lee's clothing, shoes, and rape kit.[^(\[66\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hae_Min_Lee#cite_note-66)[^(\[67\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hae_Min_Lee#cite_note-67)¬†The joint motion stated that those items had never been tested for DNA.[^(\[68\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hae_Min_Lee#cite_note-68)¬†On March 14, a city judge ordered that the Baltimore police send evidence to the Forensic Analytical Crime Lab in Hayward, California, within 15 days""

Apparently the request to return him to prison was because the victims parents could not attend cause they were not given enough time to go. So yea this guy more then likely did nothing wrong or the police are very incompetent. Or you know both could be true."
Always tried to follow it but it got my head spinning plus at the time A LOTTTA OF people on here saying he was not guilty iirc
How nice for the victim that her murder is entertaining to people.
"I think that Jay is a liar, and the prosecution was terrible"
"Seeing people comment in this thread triggers me all over again about this case.  I listened to all the seasons of the Undisclosed podcast (about the Syed case and other cases).  While Undisclosed is clearly biased in favor of the defendants they discuss they go deep into the factual evidence.

After all this following of the story, I don't have a strong opinion on Adnan Syed's guilt or innocence.  I do have a strong opinion that the evidence and case against him was bullshit.  Can you understand that distinction?   

* The case is bullshit but the man might still be guilty
* verdicts should be based on evidence, not gut feelings

When the police and prosecution build a bad case and we the jury convict we do harm to all of society.

It is pretty fucking terrifying the number of redditors (and presumably regular people in the wider world) who can look at the evidence of the case and feel **certain** of Syed's guilt.  Y'all are the sort of people who end up voting ""guilty"" for [Robert Roberson](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/29/robert-roberson-shaken-baby-texas-death-row-evidence/) in the Texas shaken baby case or [Michael Morton](https://michael-morton.com/) for the murder of his wife or taking the police's side against the rape victim (saying she made it up) in ProPublica's [Unbelievable](https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story).

Lastly, the ""Reid"" method of interrogation that many US police use is a joke.  It is embarrassing that the Brits learned from there embarrassing false confession cases to create a better interrogation protocol (P.E.A.C.E.) and the US has largely stuck with Reid.  New Yourer magazine has a good article on this: [The Interview](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/09/the-interview-7)."
"I have no real doubt Adnan is guilty.  I do question the length of his sentence.  Lots of people who kill serve less than 20 years and I find it hard to believe that 24 years for what he did at 18 would, in any way, be out of line with other people convicted under similar circumstances.  The issue seems to be him and his supporters seeking ‚Äúvindication‚Äù.  Perhaps a resolution involving no admission of guilt but no acknowledgement of innocence along with commuting his sentence to Time Served would be warranted."
"OMG this dude.  They would save a lot of money but just locking him up every 5 years.  5 inside, 5 outside."
 The law is clear. Beyond a reasonable doubt. We will never know beyond a reasonable doubt who killed Hae. The state bungled this up massively and did not do a good enough job.
That podcast was so hyped up. Disappointing in the end didnt bring any answers.
Just the way he acts I can tell he has the potential to kill
As I recall this case was a real mess and they had not real evidence against him. Also the fact that someone said he was with her at the library at the time is sketch has hell.
"I‚Äôm convinced it was Jays girlfriend. The podcast started off remarking how no one remembers what they were doing on any random day. It was not a random day for jays girlfriend. It was her birthday. It was noted in the podcast Hae was jealous because Adnan got her a birthday gift that day. Jay keeps claiming something along the lines of ‚Äúwho tf would I cover this up for?‚Äù I think he could cover it up for his girlfriend. and yes, i totally forgot the girlfriends name"
"Whether or not people believe he‚Äôs guilty, it seems pretty fair to say he should not have been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. There‚Äôs, at a bare minimum, reasonable doubt."
It‚Äôs really weird all these women trying to get murderers out of prison.
">It‚Äôs all an extremely unfortunate situation, and my understanding is that he claims to simply not remember anything during the time Hae Min Lee was killed.

That was the podcast's hook, right from the start: How can anyone remember details about an ordinary day six weeks ago?

But Adnan wasn't asked six weeks later. He was asked the same day that Hae went missing. A classmate told the police to check with Adnan because she had overheard him asking Hae for a ride that morning. When the police called him, Adnan admits this, but assumed Hae had left without him.

This detail somehow became part of the ordinary day that he could no longer remember, with his story shifting from ""why would I ask for a ride when I have my own car"" to ""I would never ask Hae to do anything right after school because that's when she had to pick up her cousin"". The former was untenable for obvious reasons, and the latter was revealed to be false as he told his own legal team that he would regularly have sex with Hae at the Best Buy parking lot during that exact window of time."
The podcast frustrated the hell out of me. The host spoke of Adnan in a nearly romantic tone. It was so weird.
"let's not forget that his accomplice admitted guilt, told a court what happened, was convicted and punished. Syed obviously killed Hae and it's a disgusting insult to her family when people treat this case like a game show."
"The fact that Koenig just discounted anything the witness said because he sold weed (and probably, let‚Äôs be honest, because he was black) was wild.¬†"
He never once called his gf when she was missing‚Ä¶. Thought that was obvious to everyone he was guilty
"For me, it left me thinking he probably did it. But probably doesn't pass the test of beyond a reasonable doubt."
The follow up stuff is not as interesting.
"Myself as well. Then I read up on this case and decided ""true"" crime was not as true as would be believed. 

But still love podcasts."
S-town was also pretty good if you missed that.
The original show it spun off from was This American Life and in my opinion is the better show. Serial lost a lot of sauce after season 1
"me as well. I had a ten hour road trip years ago and when I finally reached my destination, I was actually bummed because there was still an hour or so left. lol"
"Pings on cell towers, jay did it, the timelines are off, best buy it‚Äôs about best buy, how could he? he‚Äôs a nice guy. Jay did it!
Shut up adnan did it. It was a story over exaggerated by the impressive storytelling of ira glass and his crew at this American life"
His lawyer / friend did a follow up show herself. The audio quality was crap but it was interesting for a while.
Season 2 was good.   Season 3 had this odd like smarmy air to it.
Serial is genuinely terrible.
"Try ‚ÄúIn the Dark‚Äù for something similar if you haven‚Äôt listened to it yet, specifically season 2."
"Insane how big this podcast was for how dbz like it absolutely crawled and sputtered.


Prob did more harm than good for vigilante 'justice' for true crime podcasts than anything else."
"Listen to *In the Dark* instead, as later seasons of *Serial* are pretty blah."
The Retrievals was brutal to listen to. Well told story about a sad situation.
"I‚Äôve stumbled across a cold case I‚Äôm amazed is not a Serial series. Involving a nurse/beauty Queen gone missing then found murdered in the 60s, her mailman and her paperboy, a 1929 missing persons case that turned into a serial murder case and a major Hollywood movie, a list of suspects that went on to get caught for other murders, Johnny Cash, and Clint Eastwood."
If you like Serial .... I'd check out NPR's Embedded
"Undisclosed, done by Rabia Chaudhry and others, really convinced me he's innocent."
Check out Undisclosed. Rabia and team did a great deep dive into this case but also their follow work is much better than the rest of serial
"If you haven't already, checkout shittown. Amazing, magic and sad story."
"We all have different tastes but I liked Undisclosed a lot more than serial.  While Undisclosed is obviously biased in favor of the defendants they chose to study (Syed in the early seasons, other people they think were wrongfully convicted in others) what interests me is the deep dive into the law and facts of the case.    
  
E.g. hearing actual recordings of Jay's interrogation in the Syed case, along with having access to the full transcripts is interesting."
I binged this one while marathon training and didn‚Äôt know anything about it when I started.  It was a slow realization that this was a true story‚Ä¶ that took place about 10 miles away from where I was running.
"My take away is he was involved. Jay was lying his ass off, and between the two, they know the truth."
"My takeaway at the time was that he may well have done it but the legal proceedings were bullshit. I haven‚Äôt followed the case since, hopefully the subsequent hearings or cases or whatever were handled by competent and professional people."
"The serial podcast subreddit for a time was entirely full of people convinced he did it. Idk if it is still like that. For the record I ALSO think Adnan did it... because how else did Jay know where her fucking car was abandoned?

1. Adnan had the motive.
2. Adnan had Hae-min's trust and knew he schedule. Enough that he would be able to interfere in between the time she left school/picked up her younger relative.
3. Adnan's behavior the night of Hae-min's murder was bizarre and damning, and unless he was tweaking on some shit, does not make sense unless he murdered Hae-min.
4. Jay lacked motive and would likely not have been able to pull Hae-min away from her usual set schedule as they were not close.

I wouldn't be surprised if Jay lied about some things or was more involved than he admitted, but there is NO DOUBT in my mind that Adnan Syed planned and executed Hae-min's murder."
Without knowing the actual evidence I felt there was reasonable doubt but I also came to realize the podcast was dishonest and manipulative.
I wanted to believe him. ¬†He comes across as sincere but then you look at all the facts and it's like... Damn.
I think it was in one of the follow up episode where they said he refused to give DNA evidence to help his appeal. After I heard that I knew he did it.
Omg me too! I just kept thinking at every single pass that it was SOOO blatantly obvious based on his behavior alone
I always thought there was lots of messed up things about the investigation and trial but he was most likely the murderer.
the general consensus of followers of the case these days is that yeah he definitely did it.
A buddy of mine had the same car as Adnan. One detail he brought up that I‚Äôve never seen mentioned is that you can access the trunk through the back seat well enough that you could stuff a body through it. Explains how he could have moved the body into the trunk without being seen.
"A podcast I used to listen to described it as ""Adnan Syed is either guilty or the unluckiest man who ever lived.""

The big thing they emphasized was that you should have some sort of alternative theory of the crime, not just a bunch of random ""well you can't explain this minor detail!"" stuff, and when it comes down to it, he had means, motive, and opportunity along with a pretty fair amount of evidence that strongly indicates his guilt. Serial talks a ton about taps on the table or whatever, but conveniently minimizes/omits details like the note in Syed's notebook that was found with her name and ""I will kill"" written on it..."
Me too! Serial actually made me think he was guilty.
"I am one who doesn‚Äôt think he did it, but he definitely had a part in it. I heard another pod cast that tested the driving times mentioned in the trial and came to the conclusion the it was not feasible for him to drive that far and murder her. I don‚Äôt remember the details but it was pretty convincing. But still, it just made me believe that he had someone helping him and he took the fall for everything"
"I even listened to some of the deep-dive legal analysis podcasts after trying to figure out why people couldn't see the obvious truth. 

They got so fixated on the cell tower disclaimer that turned out to be actually harmful to Syeds case. I guess even lawyers can be dumb."
"Hm the few ppl i talked to about it had the same opinion as me. Basically, while things were mishandled by prosecution, the outcome was most likely correct. Bad way to get there, but was mostlikely the correct result."
"The correct interpretation is that he probably did it, but the evidence was not compelling enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. He shouldn't be in prison because its not about whether someone is guilty or not, its whether the court can prove beyond a reasonable doubt and I don't believe they did."
I listened to it with a group of people at work (manual labor would listen to podcasts to pass the time) and felt like I was taking crazy pills. It was so obvious he did it. lol¬†
"He almost certainly did it, they just didn't do a great job proving it, which leads to this kind of uncertainty."
"Fun fact.  A few years ago during one of the appeals trials, Syed was offered a plea deal: admit guilt and be released on time served.  He rejected the deal.

>(2019 Apr 1)  


>The deal came four months ago and brought Syed his first chance at freedom since he became a household name in the hit podcast ‚ÄúSerial.‚Äù ...

>Syed, however, turned down the deal. He would have had to admit to Lee‚Äôs murder.  
...  
‚ÄúThey want him to plead guilty,‚Äù Brown says, ‚Äúand they want him to serve four more years of prison.‚Äù  
...  
On Sunday night, a spokeswoman for Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh confirmed the offer. The deal would bring Syed‚Äôs release in late 2022."
Really? It's pretty clear to me that the police coerced his friend into falsely testifying against him by threatening to nail him with weed charges.
Because you didn't listen to a much more in depth examination of the case.
Me and my friend were also. Also the host was weird af. She seemed to be in love with him.
"The impression I got was that he very well could have, but there was no real conclusive proof."
Before Andrew from Opening Arguments got outed as a sex pest he did an excellent breakdown as to why he believes Adnan definitely did it. Worth a listen for sure.
"I felt like he likely did it, but there were enough holes to have reasonable doubt"
It really showed the podcaster‚Äôs naivety. The whole time she was basically like ‚Äúhow could someone so polite be a murderer!?‚Äù
'Making a Murderer' on Netflix was similar. They pointed out a ton of stuff that made it appear as if Avery was innocent and possibly framed but left out a lot of info. The podcast 'Generation Why' did a really good episode where they basically played devil's advocate to the Netflix series.
Really? I feel like I left the podcast thinking he was guilty.  The podcaster didn‚Äôt really give you a ‚Äúomg he definitely didn‚Äôt do it‚Äù moment. The only hesitation I remember having is that jay seemed very unreliable.
I remember listening to Serial as it was coming out and came away with a pretty confident belief Adnan was guilty. I think any level of public attention on a case is going to create a lot of noise in opposition regardless of how well done the coverage was.
The Prosecutors podcast had an incredible series on this case and just a few episodes in its crystal clear that Serial was irresponsible with their ‚Äúreporting‚Äù and that adnan is probably guilty. Totally turned my perspective around.
I felt the podcast mostly showed that the whole investigation/trial was very sloppy.¬†
"Just read both of those articles and they were incredible. After a recent re-listen of Serial S1, I finished leaning towards Adnan‚Äôs guilt. After reading those articles I‚Äôm heavily convinced of Adnan‚Äôs guilt.¬†"
I felt the same way about Season 1.  Although it wasn‚Äôt as popular I felt like season 2 was much better.
Also the way she framed Jay was so irresponsible¬†
"I enjoyed this podcast, then was hugely disappointed when they revealed (almost snuck in) the fact that Syed knew the location of Hae‚Äôs clothes in the dumpster. Clearly he was involved with the murder and the burial. The previous episodes were garbage!"
"I don't get how people think that wasn't her intention? This is where it falls on the listener to make some informed calls. Like this was a case that was decided by a jury in 2 hours but actually had real holes. Obviously if you can get 12 people to convict, then there had to be SOME compelling evidence. On the other hand: it was his lawyers last case and the Jay recordings do sound like *something* fishy was going on when the tape wasn't rolling. There's a streaker, since teenagers, a dude who's alibi was his mom and another alibi that was never fleshed out. You have an actual ""every person in the world isn't walking around with cameras in their pocket"" Baltimore murder case. Some people did some things right and some people did things wrong. And he's guilty of SOMETHING but is it murder or accessory to murder. You genuinely don't know. And the case was genuinely bad. 






As a brown person in America I can see the artistic vision of the podcast, and I can understand that what I see as many 'white voices' are up at arms about the validity of the podcast. More often than not, things are simple for those voices because the law and law enforcement more often colors within the lines. But for minorities, for all the evidence against him; there's a George Zimmerman walking free that we got to see this play out the opposite way: 100% evidence he's guilty but the law thought otherwise. Just funny how it plays out."
No one cares about your opinion you think hes guilty
"I am extremely convinced that he is guilty, but I don't think that him not calling her is a huge deal. Hae did not have a cellphone and Adnan didn't have a great relationship with her family, so he had no reason to call her home number"
"Post Serial when the legal team offered to use DNA evidence to clear his name and he declined; that is when it solidified my opinion of ""guilty as fuck""."
"I've done that in relationships though. If I don't hear from them I assume it's for a good reason. 

I'm still technically dating a dozen people."
"According to Jay, they weren‚Äôt really good friends. And he didn‚Äôt know Adnan that well. He was more Adnan‚Äôs weed dealer, and they occasionally smoked and played video games together.¬†

When police questioned Jay they told him since he drove his grandmother‚Äôs car, and had weed in his grandmother‚Äôs house, they were going to seize the house and car in connection to his weed dealing.¬†"
"One of the alternate theories is that Jay was involved in the murder such as by helping Adnan dispose of the body afterwards. I‚Äôm pretty sure it is mentioned in the podcast that Adnan muttered something to Jay after Jay got off the stand during the trial. The idea is that Adnan could have brought Jay down with him, but it would‚Äôve meant Adnan admitting guilt to do so, so he preferred to keep quiet, but he was disappointed that Jay ratted on him."
People that are guilty don't usually get upset about the possibility that they were framed.
sounds like something perd hapley would say.
"This is where I netted out. I think he did it, but I don‚Äôt think they ever proved he did it beyond a reasonable doubt."
"The huge number of people who don't get this point is the reason we have so many wrongful convictions.

It is really sad to see the number of people who are **sure** Syed is guilty.  If you are not closely related to the case (e.g. knew the subjects personally and followed the evidence of the case that came out over the years) but are **sure** of either guilt or innocence then you are on then you are the flawed side of ""trail by jury"".

The only thing we have good evidence for is that the investigation and legal defense were both shit (his lawyer was disbarred shortly after his case)."

"The words are synonyms. The mean exactly the same thing.

You mean that it is an example of the difference between the legal status of a thing, and the moral reality of it. But neither of those words refers specifically to either of those concepts."
The podcast just convinced me he was guilty
"I think this is what hooked me on the podcast, it was about a journalist who was truly mesmerized by a kid she found attractive, or somebody intentionally gasliting for engagement. One of the weirdest things I ever consumed for entertainment. His guilt seemed so obvious. It seemed so obvious he was lying."
"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to imprison him again. The courts rules the prosecutor messed up by violating the victim‚Äôs family‚Äôs rights, so they are essentially redoing the process where they vacate the conviction to make sure they do it properly this time."
I was wondering the same thing. I believe he‚Äôs guilty and I guess it wouldn‚Äôt fall under double jeopardy but it still seems unconstitutional to me.
"The original conviction was the result of a jury trial. They reinstated the existing result. 

Charging him with the murder again and having a new trial with a new jury would be a double jeopardy violation."
"My general understanding (not a lawyer), that appeal courts don‚Äôt hold trials, they just say if justice or courts discussion was done lawfully.  

Both the prosecution and defense can both have the opportunity to appeal to a higher court.  That higher court can decided to retrial etc‚Ä¶ and you can appeal again to another court but generally it‚Äôs done with it the same outcome by a different court.

So I think in this situation the prosecution (new team by the state who didn‚Äôt bring the original charges against the defense) appealed on X not being fair, it was granted and to have a retrial.  However, because it was the prosecution who requested the appeal, they chose to not press charges/drop the previous charges when it would have to go for a new trial and it was granted.  The victims family, then appealed this to a higher court, and the higher court overturned the previous court decision to go to retrial/not allow the prosecution to drop the charges, and told the lower appeal court to redo the hearing.  

While this happened another new production team was brought it, and it‚Äôs unclear if they will request to drop the charges again, so technically the charges/guilty verdict are ‚Äòon hold‚Äô and if the lower appeal court upholds the original trial, he is still guilty and there is no retrial/chance to drop charges."
"A decision can flip-flop repeatedly as it moves up the chain of courts.  When the defense wins an appeal (the conviction being vacated) the prosecution can appeal to a higher court.  The appeal process continues until

* the supreme court hears the case and renders an opinion (no more appeals on the point allowed after this)
* the supreme court refuses to hear the case (the most recent decision stands.  That is what happened in this case)
* both sides stop filing appeals (not everyone appeals to the supreme court -- it is expensive to continue litigating appeals)

  
appeals courts reversing a decision back and forth is not ""double jeopardy""."
I concur.
"They tested random items and they did not have Syed‚Äôs DNA on them. Some of items didn‚Äôt have Hae Min Lee‚Äôs DNA on them either, despite them being hers. The absence of DNA isn‚Äôt necessary exonerating, nor would  the inclusion necessarily indicate guilt, as Syed by his own admission was definitely in Lee‚Äôs car."
The appellate court reversing his conviction-reversal was about more than just the brazen violation of victim's rights. The decision brought up all kinds of issues about what a sham process the conviction-reversal was.
If you listen to undisclosed you hear in detail Jay‚Äôs ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù and how they changed over time. I think the ‚Äútap tap‚Äù episode is the one that   Really made me strongly believe he was innocent.
"You‚Äôre just copy pasting Wikipedia (which anyone can edit, such as Rabia) and acting like you‚Äôve written up some reputable summation. There is ample evidence to indicate his guilt."
">While Undisclosed is clearly biased in favor of the defendants they discuss they go deep into the factual evidence.

But they never released the factual evidence, they only brought up bits and pieces that would help their theory.

>I do have a strong opinion that the evidence and case against him was bullshit.  Can you understand that distinction?   

What evidence are you talking about and why was it bullshit?

>It is pretty fucking terrifying the number of redditors (and presumably regular people in the wider world) who can look at the evidence of the case and feel **certain** of Syed's guilt. 

Just like you feel **certain** about the evidence."
"I don't agree with the premise of your comment, to be honest. 

> Guy with a history of zero domestic violence 

- he was 18 and it was his first girlfriend, so not a massive amount of opportunity for precedent yet. He was controlling and possessive according to Hae, as shown through her diary and friends/a teacher she confided in. 

> Waited until a month after the break up 

- they had an on again off again relationship, but Hae has very recently started seeing someone new, so much less chance of being back on. This is a really dangerous time for people in abusive relationships and is where most murders occur. 

> Breakup was amicable 

- Hae had written Adnan a letter indicating that he was angry and she wished they could be friends. It was found in his bedroom and he'd written a note on it about wanting to kill her. 

I feel like it was actually textbook domestic violence."
">a guy with zero history of domestic violence commits murder against his ex

A jealous, controlling guy kills his first victim, which happens to be his ex-partner. It is not uncommon."
">The state bungled this up massively and did not do a good enough job.

On what way?"
I don't think answers were really the point of that podcast. Between serial and making a murderer my opinion of the justice system is in the absolute dumpster
The podcast didn't really tell the truth. And the library witness with her ~15-20 minutes wouldn't have helped him since he claimed that he had no memory of that day
Jays gf killed Hae bc hae‚Äôs bf liked jays gf?
"His gf likes another guy so much, she kills that guys gf, and her bf then is cool with that, and takes a huge part of the rap for it? Nah."
That was actually my theory listening to it as well
What reasonable doubt is there?
"Sir you also had no idea about the 2nd half of the headline & content, that man is no longer free lol"
Yeah that never made sense to me. If an acquaintance of mine went missing I'd be replaying everything that happened to try to find something that could help. Worst case scenario he knew she was missing within 24 hours. That's not long enough to forget. Especially when you're hooking up
"It was also not some random day, it was the day his ex girlfriend went missing! And, as you said, the cops called him that night. The premise itself doesn't hold water."
I was a prison guard on a max security unit for a few years and the phone calls between the two of them stuck out to me as very unusual. Sounded more like an inmate running game on a woman they want to send them money than an inmate talking to a reporter.
"I would say that's the rub people have with certain true crime podcasts in general. I'm not innocent of that, I listen to Last Podcast on the Left which some people find distasteful because of the comedy aspect, but I do think there are some true crime podcasts out there that just have a *weird* vibe to them."
">let's not forget that his accomplice admitted guilt, told a court what happened, was convicted and punished.

Jay never served a single day in lockup in relation to this case.  Change my mind."
I thought the season on the murder in Wyoming was really good. S-Town was also good.
"In fact, coming into S2, which was largely based on another project's work, was bad."
"The second season was decent, for one line and one line only. *phone rings* ‚Äúthat‚Äôs me, calling Al-Qaeda‚Äù"
They have a spinoff show right now about the whale from Free Willy that‚Äôs pretty good.
I disagree. Season two was great even if the subject wasn‚Äôt as interesting. Lots of serial stuff is at worst a great listen.
Season 3 was great
Yeah? Go on.
The descriptions of the nips man.
It would have been better if the host didn't sound like every statement was a question.
In your opinion? TAL is quite literally one of the best radio/podcast series ever made. That's like saying in your opinion the day before Thanksgiving is the busiest time to travel.
The Nisha call!
The state's own cell phone expert testified against them in the appeals.  I have no idea what Adnan is innocent of guilty but I'm sure that the case the police built is bullshit.
It‚Äôs a good narrative but not a good investigation.
"Yes. Serial is a podcast where a gullible radio host describes a straightforward murder case in the most convoluted way possible, and confuses herself into believing that we don‚Äôt really know what happened.

Quillette had an article that actually lays out the case against Syed in clear terms, and it‚Äôs pretty obvious why he was found guilty after just 2 hours of jury deliberations."
Will do! Ty!
Oh that sounds very much like the kind of case Wicked Words would cover in a series!
Thank you!
"Undisclosed had a *lot* of important facts that Serial left out, I listened to a wrap up type episode on Crime Junkie because they did sort of a TLDR of the important points. The one about the cell tower pings not being able to be used definitively how they were in court, the bit about liver mortis throwing off the supposed timeline, and how police didn't even look into Hae's ex boyfriend whose alibi was completely fabricated are some of the stand outs to me."
"I am pretty sure Jay was more involved than what he claimed but the only one who could contradict him is Adnan who decided to go with a ""i didn't do it / I dont remember that day"" defense so he can't. But in any case only Adnan had a motive so there is no doubt in my mind he is the main perpetrator of this crime and Jay was only an accessory."
"yes. I don't know if he did it or not, but i never felt they proved that he did."
"How I felt about MAKINGS OF A MURDERER.

Pretty confident they did it, but the police and lawyers did such a piss poor job not looking corrupt as fuck.

(At the very least, the mentally challenged accomplice did not deserve that harsh of a sentence.)"
"1000%. I believe very firmly he is guilty, but he should‚Äôve gotten a fair trial. He did not."
"This is the correct answer. If he did do it, it didn't happen like the state said it did."
There's a similar setup in the podcast Murder in Alliance. The investigation is even more fucked.
"That was my takeaway as well. I didn't feel that it leant definitively in either direction of whether he did it or not; I thought the point it was trying to make was that, even if he did do it, there's no way he should have been found guilty based on the available evidence, which essentially boiled down to a guy that the police were leaning on heavily saying ""He did it, and I know this because I helped bury the body"".  
  
So I can't say he didn't do it, or that he should get away with murder if he somehow did do it without leaving any physical evidence, but I'm not convinced he did it either. All I can say for sure, based on Serial,.is that the legal system is bullshit if someone can get life in prison based on finger pointing."
That sub is full of nutjobs that won't let the case go even after the release of 3 additional seasons. The latest one about Guantanamo Bay never got the attention that it deserved.
How so?
"They left a lot of shit out of the podcast too that made him look even worse. Including a diary entry that Hea Min Lee wrote about how she was terrified of him and how she went to a teacher to change her schedule so she wouldn‚Äôt see him anymore. 

I personally think it‚Äôs the most likely scenario that he did it. But I also agree he did not have a fair trial and therefore he should have never been convicted. The whole case was a mess."
"Hello, Ms. Koenig"
"I'm not sure that is true. His DNA excluded him from evidence that was used to convict him. That is why the prosecutor dropped the charges. To exclude him would require a sample of his DNA to see if it matched any that was found on the evidence. From what I understand there was DNA that was unaccounted for on the evidence.

Maybe you know something I don't, because I don't follow it that closely. The only thing that held it all up was that the victims family didn't get the hearing notices, and protested after the fact."
"There are perfectly legitimate legal reasons to decline giving a sample. You might not trust them to be honest about the results. You might not trust that cross-contamination wouldn't occur. If you have a choice to help them convict you or not, you're preserving your rights to choose the ""not.""

I'm not saying that was his reasoning, just that it's not fair to assume guilt because someone wants to avoid anything that could incriminate them."
"Imagine trying to move a 120lb, 5ft bag of sand. Now imagine crawling from the drivers side to the backseat without getting out, pulling that bag of sand between the front seats into the back, and then having the leverage to shove said bag of sand through a space into the trunk. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs guilty or not, but I don‚Äôt think the backseat to trunk theory is viable."
"I have to disagree with that whole premise. This is a criminal trial, it is NOT up to the defense to prove anything-that is the prosecution‚Äôs job, so no they don‚Äôt need to have an alternative theory.  And ideally (though realistically we know it‚Äôs not the case) it shouldn‚Äôt be who is most likely guilty, but who is proven beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty.  Or at least that should be the standard we try to strive for.
 
This is assuming you are talking about what you need in the case."
She‚Äôs a fraud for omitting something like that.
Tell that to OJ
"That's how I felt too. I didn't think he actually committed the murder... But, I got the feeling he knew more than he led on. After the news of her disappearance, I think he knew she was already dead. The red flag for me was that he didn't try to reach out to her. Until that point, he wasn't shy about contacting her or being in touch with her. Suddenly, after she disappeared, he didn't try to reach out to her at all... That part felt very strange to me."
In the Serial podcast they tested the driving time as well and determined that it was feasible
The murder took place in a parking lot where they used to have sex when they were together. It was very feasible for them to drive to that place
"That's *your* interpretation, not the ""correct"" one.  Most people can see the prosecution met their burden and he deserved morally and legally to be convicted of the crime."
"You‚Äôre not being downvoted because people disagree with your opinion. You‚Äôre being downvoted for adding nothing to the conversation and coming off as insufferable. Disclaimer: I have not downvoted you, but find comments like yours so self-serving and hollow. Just upvote the person you agree with next time."
"it might be because you used ""ransack"" in such a weird way. although that's not necessarily a downvoteable offence."
"It's funny because when I was in J-school we had a guest lecture from a journalist who wrote a book on Jodi Arias. She interviewed her multiple times and she said honestly she was likeable and charming. And she said she seemed like such a nice person and every time she left the prison she had to sit in her car and actually remind herself this is what she does. That's how she presents herself to gain trust. It's not real.

And the same could be said about a lot of murderers."
"The most irritating moment was Syed telling her to check the bus schedules because there was no way that he could get there in time.

So, she did.  And the detective showed her as well.  He could have gotten to the scene of the crime easily, with plenty of time to spare.

Her: so, we checked the schedules, and, yeah, it doesn‚Äôt help your alibi at all

Him:  oh my gosh, really? Like that can‚Äôt be right, really?

Her (VO): maybe Adnan was right ‚Ä¶"
"The most revealing part was where she casually mentions like twice that Jay knew where the car was. She does this almost like she's embarrassed by how damning it is, and gives no alternative explanation for it."
"Not to mention the whole ""We drove the route one time, almost two decades later, and determined that there was no way the prosecutor's timeline works"" horseshit."
Naivety is the most optimistic interpretation. She had to dramatically distort the information she found in order to make it seem remotely possible that he was innocent. There's no question he's actually guilty.
"I found that absolutely enraging while listening to S1 (the only season I listened to for obvious reasons). It‚Äôs like the host was saying, ‚ÄúHey, brown people can talk just like ‚Äòregular‚Äô people, and that must mean he‚Äôs innocent!‚Äù 

There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúSerial‚Äù if they say, ‚ÄúThe scumbag killed her,‚Äù so they did everything they could to bolster the ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù angle and, not coincidentally, their own bottom lines."
Or somebody with cow like eyes? I remember her actually saying something like this.
"Neurological naive humans don't realize they exist to be dominated by the manipulative humans. All the cues a neurotypcial relies on to judge people are utterly irrelevant to a psychopath, sociopath, or even autistic person.


Society rewards the manipulative by making taboo any venture that doesn't take a person at their word. You must assume what you see is what you get or else you are unscientific or conspiratorial."
"I will have to listen to that because admittedly having only watching Making a Murderer and the follow up doc, it did lean heavily in Avery being innocent for me, even when I would read people's theories of the contrary. I would like to hear a different angle."
"The podcast's message was ""We can't say if he was guilty or not, but he wasn't guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."" That wasn't outright stated but it was clear enough to pick up on. A review of the entire case doesn't bear that out because while there were certainly errors on the part of the prosecution‚Äîwhich is typical in many cases‚Äînone of the errors rose to the level of creating reasonable doubt. People have had over a decade to pick it apart and many have. I encourage you to read that series of articles from Quillette (a sentence I thought I'd never type...)"
"I came out thinking he probably did it, but there was enough doubt. Something about the HBO documentary removed that doubt for me, even though it is arguably more bias in Syed‚Äôs favor."
The prosecutors did a podcast? I listened to his new lawyers podcast and eft it thinking there‚Äôs no way he is guilty
"Same thing about Making a Murderer.  Both Avery and Syed were guilty as fuck, no matter how sympathetic they tried to make them.  Did enough screwy shit happen that they deserve a new trial?  Sure.  Would it change the verdict in any way?  Heck no."
"There were errors for sure. But were there (a) more errors than in the typical murder case in which someone is found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and (b) enough sloppiness that reasonable doubt was established, regardless of what the jury thought? Serial S1 picks apart a single murder conviction and does an admirable job showing that even for serious crimes, the administration of justice is fallible and all-too-human.

But it did so in a way that omitted important evidence and mischaracterized important details, while (in some parts) promoting falsehoods, along with not placing it in the proper context of murder convictions generally. The Quillette articles go into it in excruciating detail and even if‚Äîas I do‚Äîyou don't buy everything the articles say, either? It's an important corrective to the general impression left by Serial S1 and at the end of the day, I agree with that article's author that this murder was committed by Syed not only beyond a reasonable doubt, but further beyond a reasonable doubt than many murder convictions."
This is the impression that I get from consuming a lot of true crime media. The whole system is flawed and it's amazing if any guilty get convicted or any crimes get solved.
Because he is.
"True, but he also couldn‚Äôt provide an alibi because he claimed the days had all blurred together and it was just a day like any other.

Which is crazy. Anyone would remember the day their ex went missing vividly."
"Jay was convicted of his part in the crime and he confessed that he helped bury Hae. Adnan said ""pathetic"" to him in court, that's all he had to say"
"‚Äúinnocent‚Äù refers to the actual state of a person, while ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù is a legal finding based on the evidence presented in court.

Adnan is not innocent. He killed Hae Min Lee. But the way the evidence was presented in court, I think he should have been found not guilty."
"I think he‚Äôs guilty too then I remember if he plead guilty he would be out by now. As in he got a chance to say he was and he would be out but won‚Äôt admit it, WHY NOT?"
"Sorry, you‚Äôre saying the serial podcaster found the kid attractive?"
"He wasn‚Äôt found not guilty, he was given a retrial on a guilty verdict and the prosecution chose to drop the charges, double jeopardy is when the defendant is found not guilty and cannot be retried for the same offense."
It can‚Äôt be double jeopardy because he was found guilty originally.
"The defense did not appeal in this case, it was a new DA, and they appealed with the intent to drop the original charges on/before retrial."
You should listen to how Adnan's story changed over time
"Jay's willingness to give what ever bogus testimony the police want means there prosecutions case is bullshit, which is not the same as ""Syed"" is innocent.  He should have been found ""not guilty"" because the case is bullshit.    
  
IMESHO: It is possible he is actually innocent.  It is possible he is actually guilty.  



Trials should not be about the jury **guessing** between these two option, it should be about actual evidence.  Juries guessing is how we get so many wrongful convictions."
"This seems to be the extremely common issue of people not understanding DNA evidence. Its presence doesn't prove someone did something, and its absence doesn't prove someone didn't do it generally. It is just information that needs to be considered within the context of all the evidence."
I literally just said this is from Wikipedia‚Ä¶¬†
"Such as review cell records critically, interview all witnesses especially the ones that provide alibi, don‚Äôt trust Jay blindly as the story made little sense etc. 
there is a reason his sentence was vacated and he was set free."
"Both give an incredibly slanted view of the justice system. Dig into either case, and you‚Äôll realize that Serial and Making a Murder left out strong evidence of guilt. 

There are documentaries that document injustice, such as The Thin Blue Line, and they didn‚Äôt have to leave out evidence to pitch a certain narrative."
Yeah that's what I'm starting to see. The podcast was really told from a position that he was innocent.
I think there was an argument that got out of hand
"My comment wasn't very clear. I was trying to say that the police called him on the very day that Hae went missing.

He knew within a couple of hours."
"There‚Äôs no way Jay was not involved in the crime, and if Jay is involved so is Adnan. It‚Äôs that simple. Adnan can‚Äôt separate himself from Jay"
"he also didn't kill Hae. Adnan did that all on his own. Jay helped Adnan bury her when Adnan sprung it on him, then Jay later cooperated with police."
"I don‚Äôt need to change your mind. He got a suspended sentence and probation. That means if he does anything in that time frame he goes straight to prison. For someone connected to at least low level drug crimes in Baltimore, it‚Äôs pretty incredible that he avoided re offending for 7 years. 

He‚Äôs still a convicted felon. 

Whether it was the right choice or not, he did not negotiate that plea. It was specified by the judge. He assumed he was going to prison the whole time."
S-Town is by far the best series. I usually dread my long drives for work trips but I was annoyed when I got to my destination before I could finish the season lol

I go back and give S-Town another listen at least twice a year. It's such a good show.
"Adnan is obviously guilty. I mean, either Jay did it all by himself, which makes absolutely no sense at all, or they did it together and Adnan was the only one with a motive since Jay barely knew her. It's really not such a complicated case but the podcast made it out to be a whodunnit with a hint of conspiracy theory because that's way more sexy and that's what people want in a true crime podcast."

Oh and that vocal fry from Sarah- I think she had a big part of it being so popular nowadays
What appeal and what expert are you talking about? I do not recognize your description of any testimony
"The media and legions of slow witted listeners tried so hard to make it into the next Thin Blue Line but it had none of Errol Morris‚Äô exhaustive detective work or eye for detail. 

I got most of the way through Serial before I realized I was more invested in the narrative than any of the actual ‚Äúdid he do it‚Äù."
Exactly. I remember this podcast referring to a photo taken of him before the murder and they go ‚Äúthose aren‚Äôt the eyes of a murderer!‚Äù My sweet summer child.
"To be fair at the end of Serial, at least as I recall it, she's pretty well convinced that he did it, she just doesn't think that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
"I can't remember the details but isn't there an episode where Syed gets kind of exasperated and is like, ""Sarah, why do you even think I'm innocent?!"""
Season 2 about gitmo was pretty bad too. Guy steals classified documents including a detainee list and mails them out to himself and the host acts like he was the victim because he got investigated and he just wanted a souvenir.
"Yeah, in one of the appeals cases the state's own cell expert testified against them.  The original cell records from the cell company had a page with a disclaimer about location data not being accurate for incoming (? - I think, long time ago I listened) and they removed this page before sharing the records with the expert and the jury.

The whole adversarial system where the prosecution is not actually trying to find the truth but rather a compelling story for the jury makes me sad.  I get that the defense is just as mercenary in trying to get guilty people off (when they can afford a good defense rather than just *meet and plead* public defenders) but it is still sad.  

E.g. in the actual trial, the story is Adnan calls Jay from a public telephone at some nearby store (I don't remember which, Best Buy?) but the prosecution doesn't actually get phone records of the payphones in question to corroborate this point, presumably because they don't really care whether it is true or not.

The record detectives leading the investigation (Ritz and MacGillivary) in other cases do not inspire great confidence in this case."
"Fun fact, Syed's lawyer, [Christina Gutierrez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Gutierrez),  was disbarred shortly   
after his case

>  
On May 24, 2001, the Maryland Court of Appeals announced Gutierrez had been disbarred. Gutierrez had agreed to the disbarment, citing numerous health problems including multiple sclerosis (MS). In light of the voluntary disbarment, **the state's Attorney Grievance Commission dropped investigations into about a dozen client complaints that they had paid for work which Gutierrez had not completed**. By mid-July the Maryland Clients' Security Trust Fund had received some 20 claims totaling $226,493 from former clients. ""I believe this is our all-time record"", said Janet C. Moss, the fund's administrator.

While she may have been a good lawyer at one time it sounds like Syed had the bad luck to hire an attorney that was in the process of imploding."
"Which is more than enough to not convict. The reality is that we have civil court and criminal court. This was a criminal case and we can debate whether or not he should lose civil proceedings, but there's no question he should be free from a criminal conviction. The evidence simply isn't there for that level of certainty."
But you only heard what they said on the podcast. The jurors heard the entire trial and felt that it was proven.
"They had an extremely strong case that the podcast did everything to obfuscate. There is a witness (Jay) and a ton of circumstantial evidence, plus some forensic stuff. To me, it comes down to this : either Jay did it alone or Adnan did it with Jay. These are the only reasonable interpretations of the facts. But Jay barely knew the girl, and Adnan had a motive."
"Been a while since I saw that, but setting Steve aside for a moment, isn't Brendan completely innocent? 

My recollection is that the only evidence they had on him was a confession - which was *clearly* coerced, basically total fiction written by the detectives who pressured the child to agree by telling him doing so was the only way he'd get out - and then when they go to trial they present a completely different murder from the one he confessed to, since that one was made up on the spot by the cops and had no basis in reality.

You came out of that thinking he was in on it?

>the police and lawyers did such a piss poor job not looking corrupt as fuck.

This looks like very careful phrasing on your part to suggest they aren't actually corrupt as fuck, they just didn't take all the precautions to appear fully just and incorruptible. 

*They were corrupt as fuck.* And they still are, as long as either of those guys are in jail."
What happened to Brendan Dassey is a travesty.
"I kinda think if they hadn't framed him for the one he didn't do, he might not have done the one he did do."
"I think the takeaway is supposed to be more closely aligned with the conclusion that power structures are corrupted, corruptible, and often actively doing harm, and that finding and convicting accused criminals by any means necessary is not a standard of care that we as a populous should buy into. It seems effective when you‚Äôre on the side of the accuser, but eventually, that may not be the case. To me, neither of these pieces of media are about the character of the criminally charged, they shouldn‚Äôt be; they are about the poor conduct of those who we trust to ethically uphold our collective principles."
The fact that he threw a cat into a fire always haunted me and there is a part of me that feels like if that was the only 'murder' he actually committed then he deserved to do time for it - not in a legal sense because it's not murder in the eyes of the law but that level of animal cruelty is a harbinger for deeply disturbing behaviour. Also it's a really fucked up thing to do and fuck him.
Yo this is how I felt about tiger king fr
In what way did he not get a fair trial?
"There was a lot more than just ‚Äòfinger pointing‚Äô. Read the case outside of the podcast, there‚Äôs not really a lot of doubt."
"She hid the ball on the supposed eye witness who she initially claimed could put Adnan in the library at the time of the killing.  Turns out that person was interviewed and was totally unreliable.  She made it seem like his initial defense attorney did a terrible job when she hung the jury on the first trial, which is a win.  She focused on her infatuation with Adnan and his story when the physical evidence told a different story and she only did lip service to it in the last episode."
Oh yeah. She caught feelings
"DNA can't really exclude anyone, not really how it works.   
The value of a dna sample depends a lot on how good of a match it is, how degraded it is, what it is, and where it is found. 

And the dna sample you're thinking of was found on her shoes."
"No, DNA did not exclude him. That's why his conviction was reinstated"
"If it was that or prison, I'd figure it out."
"I think that you misunderstand my premise, hence the disagreement- to be clear, I agree that it is the prosecution's burden to prove guilt and the defense is not constrained to any particular method to attacking their ability to meet that burden in the eyes of the jury. I am focused on a) the stance taken by the Serial podcast, and b) my ability to pass judgement as a lay person who is not responsible for Adnan Syed's fate (unlike the members of the jury)

The criminal trial is over- the prosecution DID prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as evidenced by a unanimous jury finding him guilty. As you correctly state, the defense was not required to provide an alternative theory, but (and this is speculation) a failure to do so may have contributed to the verdict.

We can go back and forth over the reasons for the defense to adopt one strategy over another at trial, but as a podcast, Serial was free to explore whatever they wanted and yet as far as I can tell they were unable to come up with a convincing narrative for what else might have happened to the victim beyond some pretty far-fetched hail marys.

  
Edited to add: 

I don't love linking this podcast because it turns out that the lawyer host was probably not a great dude, but I think it'd be better to offer the source for most of my opinions/analysis to let you take a look if you'd like.

"The point of alternative theories is to try and cause doubt.  Passive defense when your life is on the line isn't something many lawyers would advise, particularly when there is a lot of evidence against you"
"100% when they got to that part near the end I had spent the first half wanting to believe he was innocent but by the end I was like his motive was so compelling, his behavior immediately after her disappearance was way too eerie, he likely killed her. Now whether the prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt is a different issue. And me being a big legal fan and following this kind of stuff, I never believe in putting anyone a way if the case against them wasn‚Äôt good enough to do so, no matter what I believe about their guilt. That‚Äôs what makes this America."
"I think they just mean it's not possible within the timeline of the other evidence, not that it was an inaccessible parking lot."
"The British spelling of the word ‚Äòoffense‚Äô, however, certainly is."
"Oh yeah, Jodi is a chameleon. A pathological liar. I'd imagine it'd be very easy to get fooled without knowing her history. It's creepy how she morphs."
"Even the psychologist who developed a working relationship with John Wayne Gacy said he was a perfectly normal and mostly polite guy, she just knew better how people like him work and didn't get caught up in it. Laypeople may not know the signs."
"The fact is, anyone who knows anything about this case knows the lividity evidence shows she couldn't have been buried until at least 10PM, probably later. He was accounted for at that time. The bus loop, even practice, does not matter because the lividity evidence does not match."
"Shoot, it‚Äôs been a while, but didn‚Äôt they manage to make it work but then wrote it off because they thought Syed wouldn‚Äôt have been in the right mind to move as fast as they did with cooler heads?"
That‚Äôs objectively untrue. There‚Äôs a lot of question.
"I agree that manipulation is often rewarded, but a lot of neurodivergents *are* unscientific and conspiratorial. It is oftentimes related to the disease.¬†"
"After MaM (*especially* after the follow-up second part which, instead of questioning itself in light of new/re-examined evidence, chose to double down on its innocence theory) you came away leaning ""innocent"" because the documentary was biased towards his innocence.

At the simplest level, it's just like Serial in that it isn't interesting or compelling for (potential) viewers/listeners if it is an open and shut case. The draw is in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice, so documentarians are going to lean into that. (see also The Staircase, the Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter case, etc)

Throughout MaM I was leaning toward innocent... until... one simple fact: They found her burned remains on his property.

So even if you want to say that her body could have been planted... let's roll back on that timeline...  

The woman that was at his property that very day turns up dead and her remains end up being found later in a burn pit there.  

That means one of following:  
1 - A third party just happened to kill her elsewhere on the very day she was at his property earlier and the cops, already wanting to frame him, saw it as the perfect opportunity and put her there. How fortuitous that someone decided to murder exactly who the cops needed for a nice frame-up!  
2 - The cops were so gung-ho to frame him that *they* committed the murder just so they could plant the body on his property. I agree that overzealous cops and prosecutors will do anything to ""win"" once they have targeted a suspect but I think it's a *big* stretch to claim they would outright murder and innocent, uninvolved party just to ""get back"" at someone totally unrelated to them.  
3 - He killed her  
4 - Someone else (likely in his family) at the location killed her

Granted... 4 is the real problem there. But then you have to look at the history. The fact that there had been issues with him regarding her in the past. That he tried to disguise his call requesting she come out to the property because she had indicated to her colleagues that she didn't want to deal with him any more.

Ultimately the big issue is that the remains were found on his property. That was the point where I was like ""eh, yeah... all the other bullshit excuses evaporate for me now"""
"I could be mistaken, but doesn‚Äôt she literally start off the podcast saying something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to do this if I think he might be innocent‚Äù. I would say she‚Äôs pretty much outright doubting his guilt."
It's a podcast called The Prosecutors
"making a murderer?
what evidence was presented against the two people convicted? that was a fucking sham"
"I am not really saying just the investigation was sloppy, wasn‚Äôt his defense lawyer pretty inept/distracted and made multiple mistakes?"
"Same. 

And then my fun thought experiment is how the fuck did any somewhat competently executed murder ever get successfully prosecuted before modern forensics?

There wasn‚Äôt photographic evidence until the mid 1800s. 

There wasn‚Äôt fingerprint analysis until the late 1800s. 

There wasn‚Äôt blood typing until the early 1900s. 

There wasn‚Äôt DNA until the late 1900s. 

However, reasonable doubt didn‚Äôt become defined, in the US, until the mid 1800s and *beyond reasonable doubt* wasn‚Äôt upheld as the standard by the Supreme Court until the 1970s.

Like, god damn."
"That's my impression of the system overall. It's corrupt and flawed. Our decayed, ancient US Constitution is showing how decayed and flawed it was and (to a large extent) always has been, despite its longevity. That's why I'm not a fan of Quillette or the author of those articles (a conservative publication and author), even though the articles themselves are pretty good on their own merits. I've never recommended any other article from Quillette despite reading a good bit, because nothing else they've ever published has resonated with my conscience and intellect. It's mostly a trashy reactionary rag imho.

At the same time, the case of Adnan Syed is a very poor vehicle for demonstrating the flaws of US justice, because he almost certainly did the crime, a crime that should be punished in any reasonable system imaginable. And while that series of articles‚Äîthemselves‚Äîhave some of the typical objectionable reactionary assumptions and go too far in a few places? Overall they paint a far more compelling and accurate picture than Serial S1.

The world is a complicated place."
My most traumatic day is a blur. People mentally check out sometimes. Still think he did it tho.
Yes that's ridiculous.
"Ah yes, you‚Äôre right, my memory is hazy. Jay admitted to helping dispose of the body, but it‚Äôs specifically interesting that Adnan says pathetic to him. What I meant to say was that perhaps Jay actually helped with the murder itself. Why is it pathetic to turn in a murderer? Not going to read too deeply into it but saying pathetic is like saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre guilty too, why are you acting so uninvolved?‚Äù."
"If he would have plead guilty originally. That's like making a decision with hindsight, it's too late to switch now"
Oh that makes sense. Thanks for explaining!
"End result of the first trial has nothing to do with whether it‚Äôs considered a fifth amendment violation. He can‚Äôt be tried for the same crime more than once. 

If he had been acquitted at the original trial for this case and then the state turned around and tried charging him with murder again because they didn‚Äôt like the outcome, that‚Äôs a violation. 

It‚Äôs not a violation in this case because they are just upholding the original conviction and sentencing."
I got mass downvoted once for saying DNA is circumstantial evidence. People don't seem to understand what circumstantial evidence is either.
"His sentence was reinstated.

The State did everything you mentioned review cell records critically, interview all witnesses and why wouldn't they trust the guy who was with Adnan all day who could lead them to the car? What alibi witness should the state interview you mean?"
"His sentence was vacated because the corrupt, outgoing States Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, wanted attention. It‚Äôs not because the evidence against him was weak or that the state failed to prove their case. He‚Äôs a murderer and is exactly where he should be."
Season 2 of 'In The Dark' is also very good.  Covers a murder case and trial(s) that reached the Supreme Court.
I found S-Town to be super uninteresting. Maybe I did it a disservice listening to the whole thing on a single flight but it really felt like a case of the host finding some rando fascinating for no reason.
"I had huge problems with Serial season one because I felt she manipulated evidence to make her story more compelling.  S-Town pissed me off.  The entire time he talks about how odd this guy is and it‚Äôs not until the last twenty minutes in the final episode that he says oh yeah, he probably had mercury poisoning from his work.  If you have lie or obfuscate to make the story interesting, tell a different story."
I loved S-Town. It‚Äôs my favorite of all the podcasts I‚Äôve heard.
Try Cold.
"I remember being really skeptical about the whole ""I don't remember that day, it was just like any other day""


Really? Your ex-girlfriends routinely go missing? Seems like it would be memorable to me."
"Does it sound like Ira is sucking on hard candy when he speaks? I can't finish an episode because of the way he speaks, kinda like he's choking on his words or sucking on candy. Do you hear that?"
"At the risk of being wooshed, That‚Äôs‚Ä¶. A literal Peggy hill quote, right?

Edit: lol it is. And it is also her opinion that the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest  shopping day."
"Why, on Earth, do people care so much about vocal fry"
"I listened to the first episode years ago when the hype was big, and she said something like that after talking to him or listening to him, ""he doesn't sound like a murderer"".   I turned it off.  This was just not the person I wanted to take this journey with."
"I thought the same thing at the end of Serial - that he probably did it, but there is reasonable doubt. Then I read articles about the case that weren‚Äôt so confusingly structured, and it was clearly beyond doubt."
Well her ass wasnt on the jury listening to the lawyers and being asked to make a decision. Shes just some person trying to make radio/podcast junkfood.
"Season 2 was about Bowe bergdahl. 

I think you missed the point of the gitmo season."
This has been analyzed many times by real lawyers. He had a good defense. Adnan and his family and community were committing all types of violations and tampering and lying that she had to deal with. Try listening to ‚Äúthe prosecutors‚Äù podcast arc on it
"Reasonable doubt isn't the same as all doubt, a distinction made in practically every jury instruction.¬†"
"OTOH, Juries convicted

* Michael Morton on essentially no evidence.  It is not like there was good evidence Morton had murdered his wife -- there was no evidence
* Robert Roberson - the shaken baby death row case
* [Jerome L Johnson](https://theappeal.org/did-baltimore-cops-conspire-to-supress-evidence-that-led-to-a-wrongful-murder-conviction/) was convicted before he was exonerated (Baltimore case).  Detective Massey was one of the detectives investigating Syed's case.

You can find lots of wrongful convictions based on flimsy or no evidence.  It seems that jurys are like redditor -- lots of them are willing to use the ""gut impressions"" as ""beyond a shadow of a doubt"" evidence.

From the Jerome L Johnson article link above

>In 1988, James Owens was convicted of burglary and felony murder in a murder, rape, and robbery, **based on the testimony of his neighbor, James Thompson, who had confessed to participating in the crime**.  In 2007, Owens won a new trial after Thompson recanted and new DNA testing proved neither he nor Thompson had raped the victim

While Jay Wildes (witness for the prosecution in the Syed case) has not recanted his testimony, the pattern of behavior should give you pause.  The interrogation practices of the BPD (and many other PDs) are atrocious with hours of interview occurring unrecorded."
Cause jurors have never been wrong
Even that is honestly hearsay. I am pretty sure I heard that at least one of the jurors said they felt it was not really proven. Who knows.
"> isn't Brendan completely innocent?

No, not at all.  He was involved.  I forget how obvious that was or wasn't from the absolute sham documentary (knowing how they worked, I'm inclined to think that's where you get the idea he was completely innocent) but going to less biased sources outside of that awful production, which has tained the entire industry of crime documentaries ever since, it's very clear they both were guilty as sin."
"The case was such an obvious slam dunk there was some sloppy work. But even an idiot could tell you Avery is about as guilty as you could be without actually seeing him commit the crime. 

Dassey wasn‚Äôt smart enough to plan anything."
His lawyers didn‚Äôt present a lot of evidence that could‚Äôve poked holes in the prosecution‚Äôs theory and the prosecution threatened one of the witnesses with legal action if they didn‚Äôt testify against Adnan.
"I hate asking people to do my work for me, but I haven't found any good sources or even reliable sources. Don't happened to have anything copy and paste ready do you?

Edit: yall are talking about the OP story, I thought the comment were replied to was talking about making a murderer...."
"The prosecutor said, ""His DNA excluded him."" You should probably let her know that it's impossible.

I wonder how those people who were wrongly convicted of major crimes and later were set free because of new DNA evidence, proved that they were innocent?"
"Third paragraph from the end of the article states: ""DNA from Lee's shoes ‚Äî her body was found with evidence of strangulation ‚Äî was re-examined with more contemporary technology and excluded Syed as a suspect, prosecutors have said.""

Twelfth paragraph from the end of the article says: ""The Maryland Supreme Court last year affirmed a lower court's decision to reinstate Syed's conviction because, according to its ruling, Lee's brother, Young Lee, was not treated with ""dignity, respect, and sensitivity"" when a court failed to inform him of the process in a timely manner."""
"It was ambiguous to me if you were referring to the podcast or trials in general, hence why I put my qualifying sentence at the end of my reply. 

And I agree- as people not in the jury we can speculate freely based on whatever standards, and the podcast does have a burden of proof if it‚Äôs going to try to lean one way or another (which it not so subtly did).  

I just think it‚Äôs important to make it clear the distinctions between the standards for the court of public opinion and the court of law. Again, in a perfect world, I‚Äôd like to not even consider the defense not proving an alternative in Adnan‚Äôs case as swaying the jury because they would have been given very clear instructions not to let that do so. I‚Äôd like to think it was because the prosecution‚Äôs case proved it beyond reasonable doubt. 

Unfortunately , I was on a jury for a vehicular manslaughter trial and most of the time deliberating was spent with one group having to explain to the other (despite being given very clear instructions) what we could and could not consider as evidence.  Many people are confused or uninformed about passing judgement on your couch and when on a jury. Making that clarification might be pedantic but seems to be necessary in my experience."
"Sure, that‚Äôs a defense tactic. But my point wasn‚Äôt to argue defense tactic. It was that the defense doesn‚Äôt have to and a member of the jury ideally wouldn‚Äôt hold that against a defendant if there is already reasonable doubt."
"This is what they wrote:

>I heard another pod cast that tested the driving times mentioned in the trial and came to the conclusion the it was not feasible for him to drive that far and murder her.

So I pointed out that they used to have sex in that parking lot before she picked up her cousin from kindergarten/school. The timeline is possible"
"I remember reading Jason Moss' book about writing to Gacy and then meeting him in prison. The kid was naive and thought he was invincible and smarter than gacy. He got scared really quickly.  I vaguely remember him describing the interaction as normal and then, he started making comments about bribing the guards to give them privacy.

Edit: ""he"" = gacy"
"A corpse and the science about corpses is not sufficiently advanced to exonerate anyone by a matter of hours, and corpses differ in their rate of decay based on their physical relative contents. There is nothing scientific in the Syed case that suggests reasonable doubt. Doubt? OK. Reasonable doubt? No.

However, there *are* innocent people who have been convicted of murder on junk science. Use of dogs in law enforcement is unscientific because their failure rates are greater than their success rates. Ballistics is also junk science. Not to mention ""lie detector tests"" which are merely a LEO intimidation tactic.

It's simply that this particular case has nothing to do with any of those. The proof for Adnan Syed murdering Hae Min Lee is overwhelming even though the process wasn't perfect."
"This is correct, I have no idea why everybody misremembers this constantly. Serial successfully replicated the prosecution's timeline, which Adnan said he didn't think they'd be able to do, and was surprised and dismayed when Koenig told him this."
Like what? This case is not unique. It‚Äôs classic DV over jealousy.
"Paragraph 2 is highlight the trained framework of thought and how people are judged for breaking the norms. Not whether neurodivergents are ""unscientific"" or not. Whether they are unscienfitic/conspiratorial or not also has no bearing on the likely neurotypical podcaster's own particular weakness.

Given how much of struggle it is to teach most humans--most of whom are NOT neurodivergent--the likes logical reasoning, scientific proving, or how to investigate well, being neurodivergent has no bearing on the majority of humans being very incapable of advanced forms of reasoning or proving things. Science is also quite misunderstood itself, where the observation part is often skipped or dismissed, and the validation of the observation is usually misinterpreted by the masses."
"Adnan wrote a letter to Koenig where he wrote something along the lines of that she wouldn't do the series if she didn't think that he was innocent. I am going to try and find what he wrote


Edit:


""Justin mentioned in his letter that you (Sarah) stated you would not do the story unless you believed I was innocent. And that really allayed my concerns.""

I think why everyone got hooked on this podcast is because of the production quality through audio really gave people a glimpse of being fully immersed in a ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù for the first time similar to getting hooked into a really good tv show . I think this format should be explored more and can be super entertaining when done right . Regardless of if you think the factual events and logic behind the interviewers way of thinking made sense . The way in which it captured my attention was pretty ground breaking for me personally for audio entertainment.
They didn't say that. People that only have listened to podcasts and watched documentaries often talks about reasonable doubt when it comes to this case

">sloppy work

This is the exact kind of brain poison that got 1-2 innocent men convicted. In the face of *obvious* corruption and, let's be real, **framing,** it's just *too darn icky* to think that any of our heroes in blue might have done something wrong on purpose. *Heavens, they wouldn't send an innocent man to jail on purpose, would they?? Never. Therefore, they must be guilty.*

*I see what the defense is getting at, but let's just chop that up to sloppiness. They were probably distracted thinking about church!*

I mean, we watched 2 cops make up a story on the fly, and manipulate and intimidate a special needs child into agreeing to it. Then everyone else along the way stuck by that. Through the trial, through sentencing, and the boy is still in jail for no reason. That's one obvious frame job right there. I don't see why they should get even an inch of benefit of the doubt regarding Avery, especially since it's the same bad actors, the same case, and they had real financial and personal motive to do it to Avery. Look at what they did to the special needs child, just to get Avery. That's how much they wanted him."
"Sloppy work would leave blood in a disastrous garage where they ‚Äúfound‚Äù an amo casing. Steven isn‚Äôt much smarter than Dassey. It was Dassey‚Äôs step dad and brother. Just a vibe I get. Step dad is weird, buss driver saw step dad at odd hour in A.M., it‚Äôs been years but also I remember something to do with the step dad burning something on the back of Avery‚Äôs property, and at one time wasn‚Äôt it said the Dassey Boys brother had a pretty interesting hard drive. Could all be wrong again it has been a very long time. Again though very odd to explain the RAV4 on property, battery unhooked, and his blood by the key with a matching knuckle wound that could leave that blood."
What evidence could've poked holes in the prosecution‚Äôs theory? What witness was threatened and what was the exact threat?
"Oh I see, you just don't know what words mean.

You have to look at the full sentence, not individual words.    
The prosecutor said his dna was excluded which means that particular piece of dna found doesn't match him.

That does not exclude him from being the murderer, it does not exclude him from the crime scene, and it does not exclude his involvement.

It just means that one piece of dna, that was found on her shoes, didn't come from syed.   
Which means the sample isn't particularly important because it could have come from literally anyone, at any time, for any reason.  

>I wonder how those people who were wrongly convicted of major crimes and later were set free because of new DNA evidence, proved that they were innocent?

Incredibly rare but usually happens if the dna is particularly important or was inconclusive at the time but later technology changed its value.   

Usually those cases are semen found inside a victim that definitely came from the rapist, or blood at the crime scene that must have come from the murderer specifically based on other evidence, etc.

Which is different from say, a hair sample found on a workout shirt the victim used while playing a contact sport (again, just an example).

Again, the value of dna evidence is contextual.

What is it, where was it found, can it be tied to anyone specifically, is there a reasonable explanation for its presence.

In this case it's some type of dna, unknown what type, from an unidentified source, found on her shoes.

The only way it can be important is if it's from someone who have no explanation for how it got there."
"I know what you posted. It's still not true, the DNA did not clear him in anyway. The courts have also brought up the DNA, have you read anything from them?"
"And you can be replaced for being a holdout vote. (Not saying that happened in this case.) I‚Äôve been a jurist on a hung jury before. There was some pretty clear coercion by the court to get us to change our votes, and if it wasn‚Äôt exactly 50/50 (3 votes for guilty, 3 for innocent), I think they would have replaced us."
I would argue that the reason there are 12 jurors to begin with is because the concept of the ideal juror is unrealistic
"What they are saying is that the podcast claims to have driven as fast as possible from the school to the best buy parking lot and they could not reproduce the time it would have taken from Adnan's last known sighting at school till Hae's actual time of death at the parking lot. If i remember correctly it was Sarah Kaenig who drove it multiple times. If they are telling the truth, then Adnan did not do it. This is the piece that made me think he wasnt guilty. That and the way the police had busted jay for drug dealing, a known compulsive liar, and then after hours of interrogation he told them he knew of a murder and who did it and where the car and body were located. His story doesn't seem strong enough to convict. Not saying Adnan is innocent, but no way the jury should have convicted him. Too much reasonable doubt."
"Yes, I've read things about him too! It's crazy how easily he got sucked in and then realized it all the same.Terrifying."
"What exonerated him was all the Brady violations but people hanging their hat on a liar and the State's shitty evidence they had to lie to make work is just bad.

All the scientific evidence suggests reasonable doubt because of the State's theory. Bring me a theory that has actual evidence to what happened and I will consider. All I have heard is bad evidence and far reaching speculation.

Btw, I do think the lividity evidence is concrete enough to disprove the State's entire narrative and Jay was far too unreliable."
It‚Äôs just been so long. But I want to say it was the inciting incident that caused them to utter the infamous phrase ‚ÄúEither Adnan did it or he‚Äôs the unluckiest guy in the world.‚Äù
"There we go, knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy! Thanks"
"Yeah I looked it up and I think I‚Äôm wrong. She does seem to doubt his guilt like the comment I was replying to said, but I don‚Äôt think she ever mentions anything along the lines of what I said."

Yup.  And the reporters even found a more likely suspect.
I felt exactly the same way. One of the most ridiculously boring and self-absorbed podcasts I‚Äôve ever tried to get through
Felt like a classic case of a big city media company using a small town as their own personal toy box.
Same. I think people found the *idea* of the place and people very interesting. People who actually knew what the area was like just felt like she was interviewing quacks from a pretty boring place.
"I found the storytelling style to be captivating and engaging. The story seemingly investigates a possible true crime but takes so many twists and turns‚Ä¶ much like life. It felt random and unpredictable at times, there were parts where I laughed hysterically and also shed a few tears.

At the end, there wasn‚Äôt really a point but I found it moving to learn about someone so intimately."
"The evidence for his conviction is quite strong. Serial really does not do a good analysis of the evidence. They go down rabbit holes of things that don‚Äôt matter, like many causal observers of crimes do."
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they just tell us Bruce Willis was dead at the beginning of the film üò°‚Äù

Except they're not honest with their audience about that.
"Like how whenever there's a photo of someone who later killed themselves, everyone can ""see the sadness in their eyes""."
">The jurors heard the entire trial and felt that it was proven 

How is this not implying the the jury couldn't have been wrong??? They heard it and thought it was proven, so it must have been proven.


I think he did it, but to say ""but the jury thinks this"" inherently means nothing to me in this context. The jury found OJ not guilty and I think we can all disagree with that."
Other than Avery organising for her to come to the property. Using a fake account. Lying about what interactions he had with her. Either he did it or a wizard did it.
You are quoting the making a murderer doc aren't you?
"The guy Jay had previous criminal history and they threatened him with a charge, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what it was because it‚Äôs been a looong time since I looked into the case. I believe the things the defense missed was cell phone records, photos from that girl‚Äôs house where they were hanging out before the murder, and the boyfriend‚Äôs time card"
"So, you are saying that it's possible for DNA to exclude someone who has been accused of a crime? That is something you said ""doesn't work that way.""

I replied to a comment that said that he refused to provide a DNA sample and you swoop in to drop simple DNA facts that nobody asked for and then attempt to insult me."
"Okay. We agree an ideal juror is unrealistic. But again my point is that if there is already reasonable doubt (through whatever means), a jury should not be waiting for the defense to then provide an alternative theory to vote ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù when the express instructions of the judge are to only consider the evidence provided and vote not guilty if there is reasonable doubt (or some language to that effect). I think that can be helped by advertising that fact more in social discourse."
"But we don't know the time of death. The only thing we have is two phone calls and a location (parking lot). They used to have sex there and she was murdered after school but before she picked up her cousin. The timeline is possible 

You are also mistaken with the part about Jay"
"You sound like someone who will consider both sides. May I suggest to you that you haven't been exposed to both sides? It's late tonight, assuming you are in the US. Open that Quillette article I linked and read it tomorrow morning with your coffee. IIRC the more important part 2 of the article is paywalled but you can DM me to bypass that if you're hooked. I don't want to generate income for them anyway."
Not even more likely. They found the dude that actually did it. Would‚Äôve easily been proven if the DA weren‚Äôt a racist.
I can‚Äôt believe people recommend it.
"This is exactly how I took the podcast too. ‚ÄúLook at these yokels.‚Äù 

Also always happy to see another W.C. Fields enjoyer"
"Honestly, the most interesting thing in the area is there was an actual person named Walter White using a construction company as a front for selling meth about 10 years ago. Apparently he had never watched breaking bad and didn‚Äôt realize the coincidence either lol"
"Because it is about this 

>But you only heard what they said on the podcast. The jurors heard the entire trial and felt that it was proven.

If you want to talk about how this specific jury got it wrong, go ahead and give us the details"
">I think he did it, but to say ‚Äúbut the jury thinks this‚Äù inherently means nothing to me in this context. The jury found OJ not guilty and I think we can all disagree with that.

A jury‚Äôs job is not really to determine guilt or innocence, but to decide the facts of a case *based on the evidence presented in court*."
"Jay was charged with a felony. The defense brought up that Jay was not reliable, they had the cell phone records and the boyfriend's timecard wouldn't have poked any holes in the prosecution's theory."
"If there is already reasonable doubt, sure, but I don't think that this is the case here, and what one considers reasonable is different than others yet a whole jury agreed on this one.  And making assumptions about if there is reasonable doubt probably isn't the best thing when your life is on the line (which is what I said originally).  There's no reason not to throw everything you have into your defense."
"I am open to feedback about how I portrayed Jay if you care to explain what I got wrong. I was going off the top of my head and I don't want to spread misinfo. 

I also listened to the podcast by his lawyer, Rabia. I think it was called Undisclosed. It is possible that Rabia drove that route vs Sarah because it has been a long time since I listened. However the impression was left on me after listening to everything, that although I am unsure of his innocence, I also couldn't convict because there are a lot of areas for reasonable doubt. 

I simply don't know who killed Hae from all the facts to date, let alone what the prosecution presented."
Yes. And my point is they could hear the whole trial and still be wrong. Idk how you're incapable of grasping that.
"The boyfriend‚Äôs mom was his manager and one of his coworkers said he didn‚Äôt remember seeing him there, and the defense didn‚Äôt explore that at all. The cell phone records showed he couldn‚Äôt have driven that distance in the time frame the prosecution was presenting and they didn‚Äôt bring that up either. There were other things but as I said it‚Äôs been years since I researched this case so I can‚Äôt say for sure. I just remembering my takeaway was that he was guilty but his trial was a mess."
"Let me clarify again because you seemed to be misunderstanding what my comment was addressing. I thought the comment I originally replied to was talking about defense cases IN GENERAL. Never brought up defense tactics either, not relevant to what I was saying. My whole point is that the average person is misinformed on the process (i could speculate as to why that is) and I think that‚Äôs dangerous given people‚Äôs lives are on the line. So, instead of allowing that misinformation (or in this case, just me misunderstanding who I replied to) I‚Äôd rather we talk about why that is wrong primarily instead of just talking about why the defense should have to do something they‚Äôre not required to do to combat it."
"Rabia is not his lawyer, she's a family friend who is not a reliable narrator in this story. 

Here's a thread with a timeline, there's a lot of information about this but unfortunately a site with all court documents have been taken offline so it's difficult to link to specific interviews etc

https://www.reddit.com/r/adnansyed/s/bgdOBypyZd.

>I simply don't know who killed Hae from all the facts to date, let alone what the prosecution presented.

Why? Could you explain this a bit more. Because the timeline with the parking lot and the murder is extremely plausible. What facts are you talking about?"
"Sure, but that's what this discussion is about."
">and one of his coworkers said he didn‚Äôt remember seeing him there

You are talking about something you saw/heard in a podcast or documentary here. That wouldn't help poke any holes.

>The cell phone records showed he couldn‚Äôt have driven that distance in the time frame the prosecution was presenting and they didn‚Äôt bring that up either.

You are mixing arguments up here I think. Because what distance are you talking about? What cellphone records? Adnan didn't have his phone when Hae was murdered."
"As I mentioned before, I felt that the timeline wasn't plausible. I looked at the fact that he has only been described as a chill guy (except for a young girl's diary). IIRC they were broken up for six months and she had moved on. Her new BF and Adnan had met to help Hae with her car and there was no incident. Hae's BF had the alibi of working that day but he actually wasn't at work and his mother signed his time card. And then most of all, there are no witnesses and no DNA linking Adnan. We only have a known liar's story after giving it to the police in exchange for getting out of trouble for what he was in there for. Just because he knew where the car was did not equal Adnan did it. If anything it links Jay to the murder more than him. 

*Edit: when I said no DNA, I meant besides her car. I felt that DNA would be in her car since they broke up six months prior 

I am sure I am getting a few things wrong, but after listening to it intently I couldnt walk away saying for sure that he did it. Is it plausible? Yes. It's also plausible that he did not IMHO."

He could just go for the Republican nomination. Total immunity from everything. Profit.
"difference is that he's in jail awaiting trial instead of his vacation home with golf course in florida.

Edit: the other guy even used his Florida house as a place to commit other crimes, like stealing classified documents."
Delay 9 more years and he can run for president right after the verdict and pardon himself
In this case I approve of the Shaggy Defense.

"Somehow I totally believe this Luigi guy. He said he‚Äôs not guilty man, let him go."
"Done and done. Lets move onto politicians investing scandals and rape cases instead. I think thats more of a problem. No, a person didnt deserve to get murdered, but murders happen daily in this country"
"What really happened? We may never know. Alas, anyways."
Just because you did it doesn't mean you're guilty!
Open and shut case
"

""....A perp walk,...is a practice in law enforcement of taking an arrested suspect, 

usually right after arrest, out in public, usually from the police station 

to the vehicle to the courthouse and then after the court hearing back to the vehicle, 

creating an opportunity for a media frenzy to take photographs and video of the event... T

he defendant is typically handcuffed or otherwise restrained, and is sometimes dressed in prison garb.

Within the United States the perp walk is most closely associated with New York City...



... It has been criticized as a form of public humiliation that violates a 

defendant's right to privacy and is prejudicial to the presumption of innocence..."""
"I mean, clearly the CEO was a crisis actor and wasn't actually murdered...

/s"
"The real trick is they've overcharged him. Regular old murder 2 would be an open and shut case, but they've charged him with murder as a part of a terrorist plot, which requires proving that he doesn't just hate healthcare CEOs but expected to coerce a policy change from the government. The law blogs have all been talking about it."
"Not a lawyer here, but I'd say if there is intent to plead guilty, they negotiate a favorable deal outside of the courtroom. Before the trial starts.

Most likely this has already been offered, negotiated and rejected.

Now the lawyers play their game, seeing who has the best evidence, witnesses and arguments.

Hoping for a verdict and sentence that is still a better outcome than plea bargain would have been. Including the possibilities of mistrial, technicalities, inconclusive results and even a verdict of not guilty."
Is there not a trial to determine a sentence? I have no idea how it works

Luigi‚Ä¶He‚Äôs so hot right now
"I mean, the article itself reads like a Vogue report: *""Mr Mangione appeared in court on Monday wearing a maroon sweater, white-collared shirt and khaki trousers""*"
"At this point, I'm surprised they didn't fit him with one of those masks they gave the late great Hannibal Lecter."
"100% a show trial for the oligarchs.  

Of course, I'm not sure how they're gonna find a jury that won't acquit him."
"Meanwhile, little white nationalists shooting up a Black church get taken out to breakfast by the cops. Smdh."
"That just says ""this man is so powerful it takes this many of us to counter him."""
Nothing screams presumption of innocence like treating him like a convicted criminal.
Is that normal?!? The one right behind him is just STARING at him non stop!
Not a joke though. They‚Äôre attempting to intimidate all of US. They want us to feel their hot breath on all of OUR necks and the cold steel of the cuffs on OUR wrists.
It's all show.   All the transport pictures are an attempt to come off with making him appear more dangerous than he is and is really just driving up mop sales.
"Healthcare CEO runs a hospital and manages doctors. Depending on the hospital these can be good or bad people. 

Insurance CEO runs an evil business model and denies your claims. These are all bad people."
Yeah I‚Äôve been super annoyed by that moniker.  That asshole and his company did not provide anyone healthcare.  Their entire business model depends on *denying* healthcare.
There may be a reasonable doubt as to whether he really did it‚Ä¶ ‚Äújust say it wasn‚Äôt you!‚Äù
This was 20 seconds of action out of his 20 plus years of life.
"Like the rapist, Brock Allen Turner, who has recently changed his name to Allen Turner?"
"He couldn't even have done it. 

He was here in my backyard for a barbecue I was hosting that day."
"It was less than 20 minutes of action! It was maybe 20 seconds! If Brock Allen Turner was ""rehabilitated"" after 3ish months, I see no reason why this guy wouldn't be rehabilitated after some community service."
I know right? Everybody makes mistakes!
Maybe he had affluenza and couldn't get health coverage
"That CEO had his hands in his pockets, menacingly, he could‚Äôve had a gun. Luigi was fearful for his life and defended himself. Open and shut case here."
30 seconds of action! We‚Äôre gonna ruin his future for just 30 seconds of action?!
Boys will be boys!
It was affluenza. Can't do anything about it.
"I think jail would be detrimental to his future, so perhaps just 3 months in prison and a few years on house arrest. If it worked for rapist Brock Allen Turner‚Ä¶."
I can love him for both
They're also using women as an insult a lot lately. Oh it's just dumb women who like him because he's pretty. Dumb women don't know what they're talking about. Dumb women who can't think and have no other reason to support him besides women are dumb and horny. Misogyny is running rampant in the media right now over him.
Even the late night satire shows are doing this.  Which is a shame.
"Trying to help Americans makes him hotter. He‚Äôs already hot, but the murder made him more. Like Robin Hood or Batman."
it makes me soooo mad. It's fucking Hunger Games with media and the rich focusing on the theatricals/ the gossips rather than children literally dying
"Remember how we all spent December 4th in Des Moines, Iowa eating pizza and watching movies and talking about how we have never been to New York City? It was such a nice time."
"I member. I passed you guys and you were trying to teach him to ride a bike, bc he doesnt know how. I was like ""you guys' going to get some McD's"" and that Luigi dude you were w said he was allergic to McD's so he never eats there.."
"Impossible.

We were drinking beer that day. From 3am to 9 am. Couldn't be him."
"I'm still waiting to find out what happened to my dad in 1997. If we were rich, we'd already have answers."
"Usually school shooters don‚Äôt make it to trial because they are killed.  Also, most of them are minors with mental health issues so if they go to trial, it‚Äôs much more emotional because of the nature of the crime, but we do try to handle them gentler."
"Nah paid leave for a month, then desk work."
"Mmm, no, cops who bite the hand that feeds get tragically injured in a training accident or suicidally beat themselves to death after being fired."
Except cops don't kill CEOs.  They lick their boots.
Because CEOs are more important than dead kids in America
The prosecutors plan would probably be to drop the terrorism charges if he agreed to plead guilty for second degree murder or something like that.
"It'll be interesting to see how the trial goes. If he'd unloaded and thrown the gun into a lake and destroyed his journal it would be very difficult to get him on anything but circumstantial evidence. Seems like he wanted to get caught as a martyr though, and having both the journal and murder weapon in evidence means he's probably going to be hit for at least 2 of the charges presented."
"The feds basically never charge for terrorism unless the defendant espouses extremist foreign ideology like radical Islam, and even in those cases, they don‚Äôt always use terrorism charges. Meanwhile, New York has a much more liberal application of its definition of terrorism, having used first degree murder with terroristic intent charges against cases ranging from domestic terrorists (anti-Semites and radical Islamists) to gang members, the latter category having had some cases successfully appealed on the grounds that their crimes don‚Äôt fall under the scope of terroristic intent.

Terroristic intent in this case is plausible and does fall under New York‚Äôs broad interpretation of terrorism, but is considered overcharging by many veteran attorneys since the vast majority of defendants who have historically faced the same charge were terrorists in the layperson‚Äôs interpretation of the meaning - e.g. someone plotting to bomb a place of worship. But first degree murder isn‚Äôt the only charge the defendant is facing, and the jury must consider lesser charges such as second degree murder. 

The state and federal government are allowed to charge for separate things, even if it is somewhat atypical in this case. And while the defendant might be overcharged on one count in the state system, the real elephant in the room is the federal murder charge. Assuming the evidence is as damning as it has been suggested, he‚Äôs absolutely cooked in federal court."
"While it is not impossible that the charges could be mishandled, there will be careers riding on this case, so I would not count on that.  Just saying that the charges are ""confusing"" is posturing by the defense to see if they can get anything to stick.  

Chances are, they have already overloaded him with charges, and what will happen is they just drop some of the extra charges they have tacked on, but that just gives him one life sentence, as opposed to two life sentences plus 464 years."

*Picture this, he just had lead poisoning falling over to the floor*

*How could we ignore the pre-existing bullets 1,2,3.*

*All the time I was standing there denying claims for sympathy*"
To me he wanted to get caught
"If he was the killer, I think he must have wanted to get caught, and wanted this to result in a trial. I can‚Äôt figure out any other reason."
"he had claimed in PA that stuff was planted on him. and the manifesto is lowkey suspicious (it‚Äôs riddled with typos and he hasn‚Äôt claimed to have written it yet). The gun surprisingly is just similar to the one used, but not the same one or the same exact model. I think we shouldn‚Äôt assume guilt just used, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt put past NYPD or the Feds to have some parallel construction going on. Let‚Äôs just see how his defense will be able to combat this, or how far they‚Äôll be willing to go to make an example of him, evidence issues or not."
"Manifesto doesn't prove anything. Anyone can write the manifesto after it happened. I could've written one and just say it's part of my book I'm working on and yes it's based on the incident I saw reported on tv.

Doesn't matter anyway because Luigi was with me on Dec 4th helping me put up Christmas lights and delivering gifts to children up here in Canada."
"> He was caught with the gun 

He was caught with *a* gun, I've not seen any reports that ballistics have said that was *the* gun which definitely fired the bullets unless I missed it?"
"You have no evidence he was caught with a gun and manifesto. 

The Police say he was, but we have no forensic evidence that says the gun he was allegedly caught with was the same one used to commit the crime. 

Additionally, we have no way of knowing that Luigi wasn't simply a LARPer, supporting the cause of the shooter and caught with a fan fiction in his pocket. 

That's if the police actually did their jobs right and collected that evidence appropriately, which I highly doubt they did, and also assuming it wasn't planted on him which I don't know whether or not it was. 

The Prosecution is going to have so many evidence mishandling steps in this case, Luigi is gonna walk. There's no way a bunch of pissed cops, motivated by the Ultra Rich scrutinizing them, didn't piss their pants every step of the way and fuck up procedures like with OJ."
"mmm, him having the evidence on him makes me think he probably wanted to be caught.  Dude was already in middle Penn when they found him."
"If they do and there is any evidence they weren't where they said they were, they will go to jail *with* Luigi."

Garland didn't want to prosecute Trump because he assumed Trump would go away on his own and he thought that it would make the justice department seem too political to prosecute a former president. Instead Trump will almost certainly never face justice for his crimes."

"Cancer patient at the same cancer center for the past 7 years here. I go to one of the top 5 cancer centers in the nation, and one of the top 3 for my specific type of cancer.

It's not just health care issues, but I can say without a doubt that women are not taken as seriously as men (99% of the time by male doctors) when it comes to pain, symptoms, and getting ahead on waitlists. Some of the stories that I've heard are absolutely absurd.

But you're right, as well. I've heard just as bad, if not worse, horror stories that specifically discriminate against women. And I've heard even worse horror stories about their husbands leaving/abusing them when they're going through treatment, and they have nowhere to go and nothing to do because they need a roof over their heads and food to eat. 

Which, coincidentally, I've posted before about how it happened to me with my ex fiancee. Smacking me on the back of the head when I would wake her up from throwing up in the middle of the night, shoving me if I was walking too slow or happened to be standing in her way in our apartment, hiding my meds until I completed chores after doing a full day's work from home and would be literally falling asleep at my desk, etc. Too much to list. She threatened to hurt herself and lie to the police if I called them. I eventually got out because I set up hidden cameras and got some of it on video, then ultimately recorded her when I woke to her on top of me trying to strangle me because I had been snoring. However, she didn't know how to just cut off the blood supply to the brain and basically just squeezed my neck, so I didn't use BJJ training to hurt her and instead just laid there sort of flailing (honestly I thought it would look better for the camera, anyway, as I went from 180 lbs to 125 and she had 40lbs on me).

I called the cops, secretly recorded her trying to give herself a black eye and fat lip, she lied to them, I showed the recordings, and she was arrested for multiple felonies and I received an immediate TRO that eventually became permanent (or as close as it can get) and she was thrown out on her ass with no money (holy hell I'm so glad we never got married) or assets. 

I got a bit off topic here, but my general point is that this shit happens to women *all the time*, or even much worse. It isn't just insurance that's the problem, but doctors, spouses, and even other factors that I don""t have time to mention. I actually may post more about this if anyone has any questions or interest, but am literally about to walk into an appointment and need to go."

"They reported it like that to pre-emptively paint support of Luigi as frivolous, the usual shit of infantilising women (especially young women) and I'd bet it's not even true if you counted that it was ""mostly"" ""young"" women either.

ETA in reply to the below comments after the thread was locked:

>Idk I've never seen so many women on a non gendered focused subreddit before.

People aren't usually announcing their gender on regular subs, and with the relative anonymity on this website... do you think maybe you could be assuming male as the default? I catch myself doing that sometimes to be honest.

>Around 50% of the conversation I see around Luigi is about healthcare and the other 50% is pure thirstposting. Even the news pundits talk about how he's a good looking guy.

But I'm sure you can see how the choice to focus on that on the news' part is to essentially not have to talk about the reason people are so in love with the guy other than just being hot. The choice of what to *emphasise* is deliberate, I was never saying it wasn't true that he's attractive and people are thirsty for the guy."

"I believe the judge decides the sentence based on the conviction. The conviction is determined by a jury, or sometimes the judge if the defendant doesn't want a jury."

Why why why the fuck would he hang onto those? Who knows if he would have even been convicted? He'd still be a suspect at most of he simply matched a description but didn't have all that stuff on him.
"UHC has lost nearly $100B in market value after his one act. 

I can't think of a single time one single person's actions cost a Mega Corp hundreds of billions."
Reminds me of when reddit was still saying Bernie had a chance almost up until Trump was in office.
"This 1000000%.

There was a major shocked pickachu face when Trump was elected."
"Reddit thought Hillary and Kamala were both a shoe-in for the White House as well, the echo chamber is very big and very real here."
"He is (seemingly?) guilty of murder.  I might be happy he did it, but it's still murder and he's likely to go to prison for it."
How is he innocent?
Because all it takes is one hold out juror to cause a hung jury. Just one. Fingers crossed.
I haven't seen his long-form birth certificate either.
"He was ALLEGEDLY caught with a gun. 

We've seen no arresting video even showing it was actually found on his person. 

And then, exactly as you said, no evidence at all that it was the gun used in the crime."
I was just pondering this after reading some other comment about a guy saying it's an open and shut case
Right? Like there's a lot of assumptions being made here by folks who don't have access to the evidence package.
"Dude, yes! Let's do it..."

I'm out of the loop. What happened with Ben Shapiro?
I think *dry* is just a given when you're married to Ben Shapiro.
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs dry around Luigi
Ben Shapiro's rich dry wife sadly would never stan a Mario Bros.
Yeah I think that is what people are seeing as the primary reason but I wanted to offer an alternate suggestion.
"Wil Wheaton describes in his book about getting treatment for a condition his wife was suffering through. He describes the male doctors as trying to help, but lacking. It wasn't until they got a female doctor that they made any headway.

From a personal anecdote, my wife had severe abdominal pain 10 weeks after giving birth. The male ER doctor seemed dismissive and said it was likely just from her giving birth. 

We asked for a second opinion and the on-call surgeon, a female, came down to look her over. Turns out she had appendicitis."
"Absolutely fucking true. From the most minute details down to the largest, they do not take women seriously, and their neglect scales along the racial line. In all cases, it leads to potentially fatal, life altering outcomes that reverberate through that woman‚Äôs social circle and family. Especially when the great deal of it all can be *prevented*."
I saw Tweets like ‚ÄúHe can give me back shots anytime‚Äù

"The title has murder in it, I don't think you need to censor kill"
It‚Äôs totally ok to say the word kill on the internet. Man up yeah?

"Anyone can plead not guilty at arraignment. If you‚Äôre charged with anything higher than ‚Äúbeing in the park after closing‚Äù or shoplifting a pack of gum, you damn well better be pleading ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù at arraignment."

">He‚Äôs been charged with murder 1¬†**and**¬†murder 2.

Why does this read like a line from a Dr. Seuss book"
"How is that even possible? I've seen plenty of upper class people being given kid glove treatment with manslaughter charges in blatant first degree murder cases, and it's always excused as the prosecutor being afraid to file a harsher charge that won't stick..."
"because its so high profile, theyll want to make an example out of him. so i bet the offer was not great."
"Not just that but first degree in New York is reserved for first responders, officers of the court, witnesses as victims or killers for hire, repeat offenders, mass shooters, torturers, etc."
"> Luigi may already have lawyers

He's already lawyered up and it's with one of the top notch NYC law firms. That's probably not enough to get off but he is getting very competent legal advice."
"Correct! Usually if you plead guilty, your counsel has done what they could to mitigate your charges. Going to trial means you're going to take your chances with a judge and jury and plead your case with your defense."

"Im not gonna front and say I could do better, but he does look silly as hell in this lmao"
"It really is. Cameras aren't allowed in a court room? Well, then: modern problems require 18th century solutions!"
"Even outside of that, there's a number of people that detest the current system, but don't condone vigilantism.  So even though they may be sympathetic to some degree, they're going to still find him guilty because condoning it will cause escalation from both sides if vigilantism becomes common."
And they found a jury to convict Trump let‚Äôs not forget that. Do people hate healthcare companies absolutely I think it might be a challenge between them and congress for who people hate more but that doesn‚Äôt mean a jury cannot be independent and rule according to the law.
"Yeah it'll be pretty easy to convict.  it'll be a show trial that will go on for a bit but in the end the jury is going to say ""Murder is still murder"" and convict pretty quickly"
Ya I didn't realize people actually thought it would be easy to save him thru jury.
I think you severely underestimate Gen X.

He was basically begging for it dressed like that. That little Corporate Slut
He also didnt say NO to getting murdered so you can assume he wanted it.

"It is from the perspective of the man who thought that Rapist Brock Allen Turner shouldn't have his life ruined for '20 minutes of action'.

(Note: I think Brock Allen Turner deserved much more time and deserved to have his life ruined and I feel a little uneasy knowing he's out there walking free. Luigi, I mean if he promises not to do this again and not own a firearm again I'd be like ""cool, have a nice day!"")."
What about someone that holds the highest level of judicial authority in our country ? bret kavanaugh? Is that an appropriate comparison?

I'm pretty sure that's a mistrial and then a retrial though.
"What if, and I don't ask this lightly, the potential jurors do what our elected officials do. They go in pretending they are one party and once elected, work with the other party. And this is a problem with both parties, mind you."
"I'd still say it's pretty unlikely. If I had to give it odds I'd say 85% chance of conviction, 14% chance of mistrial and 1% chance of not guilty. 

I think there's a good chance you may get some jurors that are actually sympathetic to him but say ""the law is the law"" and vote to convict anyway."

Why? Are they gonna charge him more severely?
I thought they were bringing federal charges?
And murder me and murder you.
"Some states allow you to charge multiple murder statutes.

Some states allow you to overcharge, and allow the jury to downgrade to a lesser charge if the original charge doesn‚Äôt fit.

Some states only allow you to charge on a single statute, and do not allow downgrading.

It‚Äôs the same reason people are confused Luigi is getting a terrorism charge. NY has very wide definition of terrorism, and if the murder occurred elsewhere Luigi likely wouldn‚Äôt have been charged with terrorism."
Also turned Tom Brady into a Picasso
It would be hilarious if they had one that drew all stick people.
so then why even bother?
"I don‚Äôt like vigilantism, not bc I think the ceo was a good guy but because I don‚Äôt trust copycats to pick the ‚Äúright target‚Äù.

"Possibly, but the question is, why the hell WOULD you plead guilty? You don't even know what you're about to be sentenced to. You'd have to be insane.

Also, you don't know if they have enough to win at trial.

What in the hell good are you doing for yourself by pleading guilty at arraignment? Hell, if you're gonna do that, why not go down to the police station tomorrow and confess every crime you've ever committed, since you clearly don't care about your freedom?

In fact, you might as well go call up your elementary school principal and confess to all the times you drew dicks on your desk but got away with it without detention. I mean, why not, while you're unburdening yourself?"
"Always plead Not Guilty, even if you are guilty, because your lawyer can negotiate a deal with the prosecution to reduce the charges and come to a sentencing agreement in exchange for you changing your plea to Guilty.

As much as we're fans of moral repercussions for a health insurance CEO I definitely do not want people feeling empowered to commit **murder** based on their personal sense of right and wrong or because they think the public would ""support"" them."
Very likely.  It's just hard to gauge numbers because they're not the loud ones.
"The bigger issue is going to be ""is this terrorism?"" Going for 1st degree murder allows for a lot of intent evidence to enter that normally wouldn't. You're going to have to convince folks that this was meant to strike fear into citizens or affect political change, and that's a hard sell. Depending on how badly the prosecutors fail at that, they may throw the other charges out as well."

Yes however one can plead guilty as part of a plea deal. So to avoid the trial altogether and generally do give a lesser sentence.
"Yeah, I think they are flying too close to the sun on that terrorism charge. I‚Äôve been on a jury with an attempted murder charge and that‚Äôs going to be tough sell to 12 people with varying levels of belief on what terrorism is."
"Even if there were no real way this was considered terrorism, he could still be convicted of other offenses -- most likely including second degree murder, etc. Barring something particularly unusual, most criminal cases like this will have ""lesser included offenses"" that can still end up as a conviction. 

Setting aside what's happening in this case (which is obviously unique), allowing a system of lesser included offenses is otherwise a good thing for the criminal justice system, because this cuts down on the potential for gamesmanship. As a hypothetical example, if someone beats another guy over the head with a weapon, the prosecution could otherwise not charge them with ""assault with a deadly weapon"" (or whatever a given state calls it) and just charge them with simple assault, because that is an easier offense to convict and they might otherwise let the guy off entirely."

It's going to be a circus."

"An infuriating story of someone who loved their baby being forced to give her up for adoption only to have abusers adopt her is on Netflix right now and I can't recommend it enough. It's called ""Into the Fire"" and it's a great documentary."
"Hurt and insulted is an understatement of what these men did to them. They forced them to have sex with them, recorded it, and also pimped them out to other pedophiles in their circle. They are going to be scarred for life most likely."
They probably won‚Äôt survive long.
It's a staggering amount
"I think in the cases when they say ‚Äúseized 7 terabytes of data that included abuse material‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt mean there was literally 7 TB of nothing but abuse. Rather the police seized that much and in the 7 TB they found abuse.

It could be like 1 GB of video but articles still say the full amount that was taken by law enforcement."

"Life isn't a reward, execution is a punishment. The relevant consideration isn't what we do with monsters like these, it's whether we empower the State with the ability to take lives, knowing the risks that such a decision incurs."
"And, sadly a large percentage of the population believes that because you are gay, YOU are more likely to abuse kids than  ""well adjusted"", heterosexual couples.  As a society we have so far to go."
From what I have heard they generally just put child abusers like this straight into solitary confinement (or have a separate wing for them).¬† If they go into the general population they wouldn't last long but our prison system doesn't condone execution by inmate.
I hope they live to be wretchedly old.
"And immediately upon finding that out, people will judge the gay community as a whole. We‚Äôre smeared as dangerous pedophiles and predators  around the world and as soon as it‚Äôs proven right just *once*, the shitshow begins."
"It probably is just the total capacity of all of the devices and hard drives they took, on which evidence was stored."
What's your point? Say it.
Why are you repeating this all over this thread?
Yep. Check out the post about this on the conservative sub. Lots of disgusting comments accusing all gay people of being pedophiles.
"It‚Äôs not a gay or straight problem in my opinion, it‚Äôs a man problem. Not saying women can‚Äôt be sickos, but the extreme vast majority are men. Straight and gay, there‚Äôs something fucked up going on and we really need to figure out how to fix this shit BEFORE kids get hurt."
"I‚Äôve heard that even then, they might have to deal with people spitting in their food everyday and whatnot, though I‚Äôd imagine that would vary from prison to prison."
It's sometimes call administrative segregation but even then people in ad seg still have a target on their backs no matter what. Someone who is already in their for life has nothing left to really lose if someone is going to offer them up some comforts.
"So true. Many straight couples also abuse kids and, for some reasons, our society think it is less severe to victimise women than men."
"I like how the comment pointing out statistics was deleted, but the one that paints men as the problem is allowed to stay up. Never change, Reddit."
You're getting downvoted but non-related men are much more likely to abuse children.
It‚Äôs possible that adults who were abused as children end up in prison.  So the abusers end up receiving the fruit of what they created.
"Definitely, wherever these types of animals end up in our prison system, they get the worst possible treatment that everyone can give."
It‚Äôs mostly majority groups vs. minority groups.
"I‚Äôm a man, and it‚Äôs ignorant to ignore the fact that something is happening in the development of men‚Äôs formative years to cause pedophilic attraction at the extreme rates we are seeing it. If we can pump enough funding into research for finding a way to treat this shit at the source we can prevent a lot of innocent suffering.¬†

As men it is our duty to acknowledge this is a huge issue amongst guys instead of hiding from the ugly truth because it feels bad.¬†

If you‚Äôre willing to provide any evidence or statistics at all that women are even a fraction as afflicted with this mental illness as men are then I‚Äôll eat my words.¬†

But even then it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that men are the ones who act on these desires near 100% of the time.

From everything I‚Äôve seen, it doesn‚Äôt matter what sexuality, what race, what nationality, or what religion you do or don‚Äôt follow. Men of all creeds have a problem with being sex pests, and it‚Äôs literally just a fact."
"Truth hurts I guess, people can‚Äôt put the actual health and safety of children above their own personal desire to plug their ears and not listen to the ugly issues at hand."
And that‚Äôs great. But a lot of people with whom you share social/political views are not like you in this regard.
But do you support them so that they can live a life without fear just like everyone else?
Being gay or trans isn't a vice
Isn't that the guy who was fanning her to keep the flames going/growing?
"Just plain sick. Absolutely disgusting. Poor woman, just going about her day.."
"Visiting NYC from abroad, the main thing I noticed as being really different from, say, London (UK), was the massive amounts of untreated mental illness and people at rock-bottom. Like yeah we have our crazy situations, but I've never seen so many people walking round having arguments with themselves, standing like zombies, sleeping rough etc. And then you see something like this and think 'well, yeah, what were they expecting?'. I'm not saying this to be insulting, but just to draw the dots, this woman was a victim of the society she lived in as much as one psycho."
Horrible death for that poor woman. RIP. And rot in jail boo
Where is the picture with the mayor
"I pray this POS never has a moment of peace for the rest of his pathetic life

And I pray all those who witnessed it are ok.  That is absolutely traumatizing.  I take the subway to and from work everyday and have never really been fearful until recently."
I haven't seen this explained...did no one try to help her?
"I knew a homeless teen who also got burned to death but by a group of psychotic kids. I was in elementary school when it happened but I still remember it even in my 30s.
May this pos get what he deserves and my deepest condolences for the victim and loved ones if there are any which maybe she didn't....üò¢"
One of the worst videos I've ever seen don't watch it
"I‚Äòm glad they found him so quick.
That poor woman.
No matter how quick,
It wasn‚Äôt quick enough. 
I hope he gets whatever he deserves after this"
Jeeze how flammable was her outfit. The video is horrible.
Migrant policies need a rework. This isn‚Äôt acceptable.
Surely they'll be charged as a terrorist.
"The line needs to be drawn, this is too common."
Dream scenario for Adams. More than likely an illegal migrant for him to harp on to get a Trump pardon.
"Well I‚Äôd hope they fucking caught him, seeing as to how he sat right there watching her burn as cops walked back and forth being of no help. Shit, he even got up and fanned the flames on the poor woman at one point. This title makes it seem like it was difficult to find the guy‚Ä¶."
Why is everyone desperately trying to make smug comparisons to the CEO case? Reddit is a weird place. RIP lady
I wonder what his immigration status is?
"Headline should have read, "" Another illegal immigrant kills, a U.S. citizen today on a NYC subway car"""
"I hate how much this world hates women. Fuck this guy. May he never find peace. Absolutely pathetic act. 

That poor woman didn‚Äôt deserve this fucked up death."
He looks mentally ill in that picture
"crazy how MSM try to say that the woman caught fire and tried to ignore the fact she was lit on fire by a illegal immigrant.

  
they make it seem like it was spontaneous combustion or something, just like they try to say ""car rammed through crowd in germany"" or ""flames attacked church in Canada"""
"Thank eric adams and kathy hochul for allowing these degenerates into nyc.


Edit: until it happens to you keep sympathizing."
"People walking around as tired, mentally unstable zombies at rick bottom is unfortunately an intended feature of our country. Cant work the populace like slaves if they feel they have any stability or safety nets, or if they dont have constant reminders of how much worse it will be if they fall out of the rat race."
Will Eric Adams be looking him in the eye for his perp walk?
[deleted]
Where's the perp walk?
"Good work catching him, crime is not classless."
[removed]
The people watching her burn and the cop should be charged too
New York is a perfect hellscape that can no longer be obfuscated by corporate media or Hollywood propaganda.
"oh, would you look at that, the cops did catch him.

Now everyone can stop complaining about how much effort the cops put into catching Luigi?"
"Yes. The cops walked right past him. Twice. And before he started fanning her, he was just sitting calmly on a bench watching her burn."
"Look I‚Äôll say this as someone who struggles with mental illness and has spent time in a psych ward. We need long term care facilities for a lot of people. They cannot function in society, cannot have a job, maintain relationships. They are not criminals and don‚Äôt belong in jail but we also can‚Äôt leave them on the streets."
"Lived in NYC all my life. And every city has its share of homelessness, drug addicts, mental illness. What makes it worse here is that there are like over 8 million people living on top one another in a 10 mile radius. 

I'm so tired of it. Getting on a train after a beat day at work and having 80 people huddled on the corners of each subway because someone is going crazy in the middle. 

I have no solutions, I'm just venting"
Unfortunately there's an attitude that there's nothing we can do about it.
How do other countries care for their mentally ill?  Do they force them to take medication? Institutionalize them?
Don‚Äôt go to LA. Holy shit the homeless population and the situation u mentioned mentally was very jarring. And I live in a big ass city.
America is a country without balance/moderation. You‚Äôll do really good or you‚Äôll do really bad.
NYC is turning into a hellhole again. Look at the leadership. The mayor's a crook. Former mayor was a disaster. The former governor was a disaster.
"In my (admittedly limited and non-native New Yorker) experience, it‚Äôs really increased post COVID and under Eric Adams. But by and large, these people are more often the victims of the worst kinds of crimes, as was the case here. They‚Äôre just such easy targets"
"I‚Äôm from the US, but in a way, same. NYC isn‚Äôt really a representation of most places here. Whenever I go, it‚Äôs a bit of a cultural shock for me as well. Last Christmas, I actually visited with my mom, and as I exited the train station, some dude just decided to run up and attempt to punch me in the face! It was so crowded on the sidewalks, I guess he lost his nerve? I screamed and cowered, and nobody around me batted an eye, but my mom was pretty upset."
"And not just that, when someone intervenes to protect the public, NYC says the Good Samaritan is the problem!"
"The problem is largely that these types of failings are never viewed as societal in the US, people here are hot wired to view this situation as a personal or moral failing in order to obscure or misdirect blame"
"lol, I had a buddy at work that grew up in NY and he tried to claim to me that NYC is better than SF because NYC got rid of all the homeless, ‚ÄúThey bought them all tickets and sent them to other states so it‚Äôs all clean there now.‚Äù. I literally busted out laughing at him!"
"From what I understand different laws in keeping people in mental facilities, alot harder in the US to intern them against their will, when they don't want help."
"Because we'd rather let people suffer the worst of human existence than give anyone a handout! Society is just a thing that serves *me*, not the result of the culmination of everyone else's experience! Why should anyone get help that I don't personally benefit from? If you want government welfare, you have to sell your life to the government by joining the military.  My taxes only go to propagating the rich, the elderly, and the ruling class, *not* the sick or the poor.

That's why we need guns. To protect us from the undesirables. Duh."
As someone who is reasonably considered sane I am offended at your assumption that I am mentally unwell for arguing with myself in public. I prefer to call it monologuing.
"I remember going to Chicago years ago and seeing two parents and a young boy, probably around 6, sleeping on the street.

I now work in mental health/social services and it‚Äôs terribly sad how limited the resources are."
You‚Äôll see this at nearly every big city in america
"welcome to america. i was so shocked when i went to London, the lack of aggression on the streets. the lack of homeless. sure, you have them, but not in the numbers you get used to as an American. The incredible diversity, people just making room for each other,....it was incredible. Say what you want, London and the UK in general is quite different in a positive way than anyplace in the US."
You‚Äôre right on the mark. We‚Äôve allowed it to reach truly unconscionable levels here
"I had the same experience when I visited NYC and Washington DC.

Sure you get these issues in every city, but I was shocked at how many people I encountered (probably) struggling with mental illness."
The murderer was an illegal immigrant. ¬†I 100% agree about America having a mental health crisis but I‚Äôm not sure you can blame that when the person isn‚Äôt American or even a legal resident.
NYC looked rough as hell from an outsiders perspective during the 70s & 80s
Thanks Ronald Reagan!
"And if you're visiting, chances are you don't see the worse of it. Touristy areas or areas worth going through tend to have a lot of them, but still a fraction of what you see elsewhere.

I live in a more upscale neighborhood, and when I go out of my way for some reason or another, the contrast is unfortunately stark. If I had a clicker to count the amount of crimes I see, or people in distress, as I just walk through 2-3 blocks, I'd be clicking non-stop."
"Add onto the mental illness with Tiktok Brain, or overly assumptuous and delusional thinking, and it's really a gamble when you talk to strangers. I'm exhausted of dealing with people who think they can assume my mood or thoughts with 100% accuracy, for example. It can be crazy, dangerous and annoying to deal with the heavily deluded. The delusion can be *strong* nowadays thanks to neverending echo chambers on topics."
"It's because the police don't do shit and just stand around and collect a check. Then people say ""well it's crazy out there, what do you expect the cops to do? ... this fucking job lol we'd also arrest people for smoking a plant that is legal in majority of states than fund mental rehab facilities ... when you tell people that's what taxes fund they'd rather butch about the issue than have their taxes raised 10$ a month."
"Unlike the UK, America doesn't have a national healthcare system...which means that America doesn't have a national mental healthcare system either."
The republicans shut down all the mental health asylums and just dumped the patients on the streets in the 1980s I think and that‚Äôs just how‚Äôs it been since then
You‚Äôre not going to believe SF. Hoodmaps sketches out the unwalkable areas.
We can thank Ronald Reagan for closing all the places where these people would have been helped‚Ä¶
"Welcome to the great USA. It‚Äôs like that all over the place, and our government is all about cutting funding for treatment and turning these people loose on society. Remember when straight jackets and institutions were a thing. They politicized the horrific conditions of those places to shut them down. It‚Äôs all about the money. Granted, those places were probably pretty bad, but that was the problem that needed to be fixed. Shutting them down was not a solution."
Welcome to America :)
"Are you a ghost, why the ""boo""?"
"This just sounds like someone from District 1 in Hunger Games. Just totally out of touch, or a bot"

Victim‚Äôs net wealth must surpass a certain threshold for mayor to make the photo
"He's not a photogenic white guy, who merc'd a rich white guy."
Can we just not.... use this woman's death as a way to simp for Mangione? Please? It's kind of gross.
NPR reported an MTA employee used a fire extinguisher but it was too late.
"I haven't seen the video myself, but from what I read in previous comments, no one helped. I'm assuming everyone was in too much of a disbelief / shock to be able to move."
"The fact that it was a train pulling into the terminal at a time and day where there very likely might have been no passengers in that car other than the victim and the assailant might have had something to do with ""no one tried to help.""

I mean, there was a fire. Burning clothes give off a lot of smoke and can be smelled from some distance. That no one was screaming ""Fire!"" or running from the area means no one was in the vicinity. The smoke was smelled by police on the upper level of the station, and they immediately ran downstairs."
I guess screaming and throwing ineffective objects at her would make people feel like they‚Äôre helping.
"Last guy who tried to help on a subway had to fight for his life in court.

Riding the NYC subways is insane.  I‚Äôve seen horrible shit over the years and have been put into positions that could have really impacted my life‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sure the same plays out for thousands of people each day.

So glad I‚Äôm out of that city"
"Nope. A woman was publicly raped in transit and people just recorded on their phones 2021 (none called 911 or gave police the footage, they kept the videos for themselves to upload on the internet later). Another was stripped naked by an almost rapist in 2023 also in public and also in NYC. Women are not safe on public transportation because people get 'bystander syndrome' which means theyre too fucking stupid to help anyone because they think 'well if someone else isnt helping, then its probably okay'. If you ask me, anyone who doesnt attempt to help in those kind of situations are accessories to the crime and should be punished."
">I haven‚Äôt seen this explained...did no one try to help her?

Well, the last guy who tried to prevent a mentally ill man from murdering other passengers ended up on trial, so‚Ä¶"
the last guy who tried to help in a subway emergency was tried for manslaughter. This is terrible.
"They recorded it. And watched.

And they wonder why there‚Äôs no sympathy for the crimes committed in NYC when the bystanders act like that."
"I was also wondering this. Natural fibers burn; polyester melts; leather resists flame. I'm not sure what combo makes you go up so fast you can't stop, drop, and roll in time to save yourself, but I would like to know. The article I read made it sound horrifically fast."
"1. Yearly cap on asylum claims. 
1. Higher bar for what qualifies as a valid claim. Only wars, genocides, etc. Gang violence is not good enough, we have gang violence in the US. The world sucks, we can‚Äôt just accept unlimited randos forever.
1. You need to apply from the nearest safe country, not at the US border. Syrian refugee? Apply from Turkey. We can‚Äôt have unvetted people roaming the country for years waiting for their asylum claims to be processed.
1. If your country‚Äôs situation gets better you have to go back."
"Terrorism is about motive and so far this person‚Äôs motive is unknown. 

But NY has included terrorism amongst the charges [for serious subway crimes in the past](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/frank-james-pleads-guilty-mass-shooting-new-york-subway)"
Not unless it was motivated by political or ideological reasons.
They will be deported as reportedly they are an illegal immigrant that has already been deported once.
Why? I read the entire article thinking ‚Äúwhat does this have to do with terrorism?‚Äù  And I still have no idea.
I‚Äôm seeing this a lot. I didn‚Äôt know people were so ignorant on what the definition of terrorism is.
I'm curious why you think that?
Immigrant from Guatemala - Fox News is going to have a field day with this.
Yup. Illegal who was deported and then snuck back in.
Except this person entered the country in 2018‚Ä¶when Trump was president
Because a lot of Redditors confuse snark for having an¬†opinion.
"""Errrmmm why isn't this guy pictured with the mayor???? Why didn't they spend millions of dollars hunting this guy?????""




Idk, maybe because you idiots turned the other guy into an international celebrity?? Think that has anything to do with the disparity??


Redditors are unbelievably dense"
"It took place in NYC

It is a murder

There is a suspect at large

Not hard to figure out why. I suspect you were making a smug statement yourself, however."

see how unfair that is?"
New York doesn't have the death penalty
There was a guy who intervened to help women from a lunatic recently and they charged him with murder! (Jury didn‚Äôt convict though!)

"He didn‚Äôt even try to escape the scene and it still took them hours to find him lol¬†

‚ÄúUnbeknownst to the officers who responded, the suspect had stayed on the scene and was seated on a bench on the platform just outside the train car, and the body-worn cameras on the responding officers produced a very clear detailed look at the killer,‚Äù"
"Surely this is not the guy! They are framing him! Why would a wanted murderer just be riding a subway train, that makes no sense! /s"
Lmao look at our for profit health care and prison systems and tell me this country gives a shit about the value of human life.
Get used to it... ooooor we can just not let them in our society.
no we don't. were just going to deport the illigal ones.‚Äã
"Quick question, what country was Jorge Ubico allied with?"
Tbf I don‚Äôt think any of us would have expected the assailant to remain at the scene. If I saw him fanning I‚Äôd probably think he was an idiot who didn‚Äôt know how to put out a fire.
One of the stupidest things we ever did as a country was just give up on those with severe mental illnesses by throwing up our hands and closing all of our long term psychiatric facilities instead of trying to fix the system.
"We know a woman in our extended circle who set her own apartment on fire on purpose a couple years ago (I don't know the details of how large the fire got before they were able to put it out, but as far as I know no one was significantly injured). She was deemed not guilty due to mental illness. 


They let her go home.


And you know, on the one hand, I'm happy for her. Losing your liberty is terrible, and being punished for being unstable is also terrible. But at the same time, she set her apartment on fire on purpose, and she is so unstable that the courts decided she shouldn't face a penalty for that. Just perhaps, she should be under supervision because she is clearly a danger to herself and others. It is wild to me that you can purposefully set part of a building on fire that other people live in **and are in at the time** and get to just go home."
"But we need to properly fund them and staff them with intelligence, good pay and patient to staff ratios, and lots of well funded oversight."
And we need involuntary treatment. Bottom line.
"*some of them are not criminals 

Many are in fact criminals"
"What is the difference essentially of an institution you are forced to go to, not allowed to leave, and have people do things to you that you don't want them to VS jail? Given the state of other institutions, what do we expect conditions in these places to be like? We can't even have nice nursing homes and elder care for a vulnerable and loved population. It would take a massive amount of money to set up institutions for these people that would care for them and not be a horror show, additionally, people have demonstrated they are not willing to spend money on this population.  
I would love a state-of-the-art facility that is a nice place for these people to heal or live out their lives with the staff paid well and everyone's rights respected but it seems completely unrealistic and ripe for abuse. We can't even house the not crazy or drug addicted homeless.  
Something needs to change for sure, but I'm worried about society going down this road especially with how cruel it has become, with our terrible leadership (from all sides), corruption and greed."
We need a welfare state. It is not possible to maintain real civilization if we are unwilling to support people who cannot work.
"Long-term care yes. But that also doesn't mean asylums and so on. Mental illness gets worse without treatment, and being on the streets is only going to exacerbate that through additional stresses and substance abuse.

A lot of ""mental illness"" would also be treated with social safety nets."
Well Americans don't want to pay for it. They don't want to pay for ANYTHING.¬†
"That's difficult for a number of reasons.


In Canada we still have federal mental hospitals and clinics, but drug use and mental illness are worse than ever.


You need funding, which many are opposed to, but people need to voluntarily seek treatment.


You can't force someone into a mental hospital unless they commit a crime and the punishment is psychiatric care. Or they prove to be so dangerous they can't be part of society.


I don't think any western government is going to start rounding people up and putting them in mental hospitals.¬†"
And we can thank Reagan‚Äôs administration for deciding we don‚Äôt and look at what that‚Äôs caused
"Yeah, it's the bit statistics per capita tend to miss. NYC is pretty safe per capita. But if you live in the middle of nowhere and someone commits a crime, there might be 1-2 witness. If you live in NYC and someone commits a crime, there might be 200 people who saw it happen, and 100,000 people who can relate because it happened in their neighborhood/block.

That has a serious impact on one's psyche. It also gets normalized much faster."
It's not that there's nothing that can be done it's that doing anything requires political will (and money)
"Institutionalization for those who are a danger to themselves and others and community group homes for those who can live semi independently but still need structure- and yes those who are institutionalized are medicated.

This was the model Jimmy Carter put into place that was immediately dismantled by Regan. There's a lot in the US that was on the cusp of following social democracies in Europe around that time- socialized healthcare being another. 

All of it was either repealed, dismantled, or blocked by Regan and Newt Gingrich."
"Contrary to popular belief, many people do seek treatment at the beginning of having mental health symptoms, especially with anxiety and depression which many times leads to substance abuse by ""self medicating"" . In the US, a large number will be denied treatment since they don't carry health insurance, unlike other countries that provide health services to their citizens without or at minimal cost. 

In Eastern cultures, it's much more family-oriented and family will care for members who are ill instead of letting them fending for themselves on the street."
"I live in the US, but I‚Äôm from Mexico City and have lived there for extended periods of time. While Mexico City is a gigantic city, larger than NY in population, the homeless situation is not like anything you would ever see in the US, even in medium sized cities. Not to mention places like LA or SF.
There ARE homeless people in Mexico City, but nowhere near as many. I think there‚Äôs several factors that affect this, not just one. 

1) Social and family bonds are much stronger in Mexican culture. Usually people with health or mental problems or tough financial situations don‚Äôt just get kicked to the curb by their families. Families, and even extended families tend to lend a hand a lot more than in US society.

2) There is somewhat of a safety net. Not the best, not as good as it should be, but it definitely helps some. I don‚Äôt think this is as bad anymore (though it‚Äôs not a solved issue by any means), but in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs there was a larger problem with homeless children. These kids were mostly orphaned or runaways and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to see them begging on the streets. This was happening when Mexico was having a population explosion especially in rural areas with crushing poverty. Many of these people migrated to the cities to try to escape poverty and when families were having 7,8,9 kids, they just kinda fell through the cracks. There‚Äôs a government institution called DIF (Desarrollo Integral Familiar) which roughly translates into ‚ÄúAgency for Integral Family Development). DIF runs state run orphanages and foster systems to try to rescue these kids and they have made a lot of progress on that front.
As far as adults go, there‚Äôs government healthcare and mental health meds and care are easily and readily available for the most part. Again, it‚Äôs not a perfect system and the quality of care is spotty at best, but it‚Äôs something. This also includes mental hospitals and the like. Surely there‚Äôs some bad things going on in some of those and I‚Äôm sure they could definitely be better, but at least they‚Äôre something.

3) Shanty towns.
Shanty towns aren‚Äôt pretty, but they do provide a pressure valve that allows people who would otherwise be homeless to love somewhere. For those not familiar with what a shanty town is, it is an area usually on the outskirts of the city, where working poor and borderline homeless people are unofficially allowed to settle. Kinda like Brazilian favelas. The government kinda turns a blind eye and people just start building their homes from makeshift materials. There are no city services at first as these places are an informal community. There are no building codes or anything. These places are usually ugly, dangerous, and isolated. However, with time, some of these places start a process of formalization and start receiving public infrastructure services like electricity and sewage and water, etc. it‚Äôs usually a very long process than can take decades but it eventually transforms these places into legit neighborhoods."
"They have safety nets to ensure people are supported before they get this bad.¬† They also, at least as far as I know, do not have the severity if wealth distribution we have - meaning they don't have as large of a population that lives in despair with no chance of improving their lives turning to drugs.¬† They also don't have drug companies pushing severely addictive opioids for years, unchecked, that created an alternative for all the despair.


It's a situation that has been brewing for over a decade that was accelerated by covid isolation and brain damage."
I am certain feeding a steady diet of hatred on social media has way more to do with influencing how they are manifesting that illness than anything else.
"A homeless person murdered my cousin who was a well known music producer at the beginning of this year in fucking Santa Monica. Had another cousin's girlfriend's grandfather who was mentally unstable and homophobic take her life 4 years ago.

I spent most of my adult life abroad, and have every bit of reason for me to want back out permanently.

Having grown up and raised around and in LA, this has been the most violence my family has gone through, and shit was WILD in the 80s and 90s. I am sure even where my cousin lost his life is probably a well-to-do area with highly rated locations all over it, yet anything can happen anywhere here these days. I live here, but I am good on LA."
"For real. I‚Äôm from the East Coast, I visit New York and Boston pretty regularly. I‚Äôve lived outside of Detroit and Baltimore. Nothing compares the the situation in California. I‚Äôve never been to LA, only San Diego and San Francisco, but it‚Äôs absolutely beyond crisis levels."
"Yeah after going home to Los Angeles to visit family I owed the NYC subway an apology. LA is basically unusable, its completely overrun with homeless encampments. Some of those stations are the dirtiest places I've ever been."
Plenty of neighborhoods in LA without homeless around worth visiting. They cleaned it up a lot a year after the pandemic ended.
Don't forget- the police chief is a sexual predator.
Native New Yorker and lived there for over 30 years and I 100% agree with you about there being a shift around COVID and getting worse with Adams. It literally felt like the homeless population shifted from quietly existing on the sidelines to being loud and belligerent almost over the course of weeks. My guess is whatever resources they had for psychiatric treatment for them must have dried up during the pandemic or something.
Ok‚Ä¶ now what?
"This was mainly on and around public transport travelling through from NJ to JFK, but I'll expand this out to Philly as well. I can only speak for myself, and in impressionistic strokes at that, but really got the feeling there were just so many... forgotten people, I guess? There's worse places for sure, and it was in scale more than degree, so perhaps it's just concentrated, but yeah. The vibe I got was if you were clearly in distress, you'd be ignored extra-hard.

Edit- there are other people who can vote on your comment dude. Just be patient."
"There‚Äôs usually a lot near Fulton station, then maybe in LES/East Village I‚Äôve noticed some crazy people walking around.

Other spots include:

Washing Square 4th street stop

Union Square near the subway stops 

Penn station"
That *was* his boo
"No one in the crowd is booing you, sir. They're saying ""Boo-urns!"""
"""boo"" means ""sweetie"" in this context."
Some people call others boo. This isn‚Äôt abnormal.
No big media coverage and captured the same day.
Everyone keeps saying this but people aren‚Äôt gathering to support this murderer. Luigi had a posse in case someone tried to obstruct their path/free him.
"They're not simping for Mangione, they are pointing out the extreme hypocrisy with how law enforcement handled the death of a CEO vs the death of an ordinary citizen."
"Youre on Reddit, this place has no moral compass, they want to cosplay as class revolutionaries when most people here are legit losers."
It‚Äôs not simping it‚Äôs pointing out the mayor‚Äôs disregard for victims that aren‚Äôt billionaires. Dude wanted to be photographed at Luigi‚Äôs perp walk for clout but he‚Äôs not gonna do it for this poor woman god rest her soul. Fuck Adams
"What's gross is that a woman got burned to death and the NY legal system reacted with a resounding ""meh"" because she's not anywhere near as important as someone who controlled billions of dollars and was in the position to hand out massive political contributions and loan out the corporate jet to the mayor and congress members.

That's what's gross.

Now you know where this poor woman (and you and your kids) rank in the legal system."
"In the video the guy who did it is sitting on a bench watching her burn. She is standing up in the subway, the doors are open, and she is totally on fire. at one point she slightly moves a leg. It was horrific. Wish I hadn‚Äôt seen it."
I watched the video. A cop literally walks by and ignores her.
"There were people. Someone stood there and filmed it, a cop walks right by the woman on fire and the man who set her on fire.

I can understand people not wanting to risk their own safety but after watching the video I‚Äôm really struggling to understand the complete lack of humanity."
A cop calmly walked by while she was aflame.
about 4 million people ride the subway everyday and a vast vast majority never have a problem.
"someone choking a guy out for yelling is not the same as someone helping put out a fire... I also live here, pretending you have to kill someone to assist is wild."
How is it that I‚Äôve ridden the subway hundreds of times and never feared for my life? Am I just really lucky?
"You are over 100 times more likely to die in a car accident than on the subway. I‚Äôve lived in NYC for 10 years and never seen any crime on the subway. Which is normal.  

Riding the subway is not ‚Äúinsane‚Äù, it‚Äôs mostly efficient and cost and space effective and way better for the environment etc etc."
"You never lived in NYC, laying on the internet, embarrassing.¬†"
I mean he did the same thing as this he just murdered a homeless person on the subway.
"You mean the guy who fucking also murdered a homeless person? And got away with it and is being touted around as a celebrity and hero? And you‚Äôre trying to get us to feel pity for him under the story of another potentially unhoused person murdered on the subway? 

Insane. Daniel Penny and the fucker who burned this woman to death are cut from the same, shitty, lacking-in-respect-for-all-human-life cloth."
Nobody on the scene knew he was the perpetrator until later. A bunch of kids called in that they saw somebody matching the bodycam footage and they found and arrested him then.
"Do Americans truly hate eachother or what is going on over there to make people behave like this? 
There's multiple stories in this thread alone that I couldn't even imagine happening in the UK where I am, or any other country in Europe for that matter. Someone tries to rape someone on the London underground they are getting fucked up for sure."
"nobody there knew who did it and it's someone actively engulfed in flames with no fire extinguisher around. I live here and have been in multiple incidents on the subway were people stepped in to kick someone off the train for causing problems.

if that's why you feel no sympathy I would imagine you would care enough to learn more about the situation"
This happened to me woman in Toronto two years ago and was for those reasons right? Scary that such a specific killing has happened to these two people.
"Not politically motivated, but will be motivation for politics"
"This crime involved two poor people, so nobody cares and they're trying to make it about the CEO shooter."
He was deported in 2018 and returned years later
He was deported then came back over the border under Biden.
So you agree that trump should deport more?
"He entered in 2018, was swiftly deported a few days later, and then re-entered sometime between then and now."
Where did you read this information?
That doesn't change the fact he's illegally in the country. At least Trump tried to stop the inflow unlike Biden actively reversing policies to stop them coming in.
">There is a suspect at large

He's been arrested. It's in the headline."
‚ÄúThere is a suspect at large‚Äù bro you are replying to a headline stating the suspect was arrested. Anyways this is classic reddit brain of being willfully obtuse. No shit there is hypocrisy between why there was a manhunt for luigi vs a migrant killing a homeless woman‚Äîtwo classes of people no one truly gives a shit about until it‚Äôs politically convenient.¬†
"The CNN article basically has 0 information about the suspect, even though several other outlets have verified and published he's in the country illegally."
"No, it isn't unfair. Illegal immigration is a problem. Legal immigrants are all against illegal immigrants."
"1. We already prioritize women and children in our official refugee program (where we get to decide who to admit), partially because men tend to commit more crimes.
2. Even if we decided not to let men in, it wouldn't have stopped this guy. Since he entered illegally. He was deported in 2018, and snuck back in sometime after that.
3. Are you saying we should change the rules so people like him should be admitted?"
this seems like an honorary throwback moment
"What? I‚Äôm not blaming all men or migrants. 

I‚Äôm blaming this global culture of ‚Äúfuck women, I like to see them in pain.‚Äù This guy was sick and cruel. I‚Äôve worked with many migrants who would agree."
"100% agree and it is INSANE that you can‚Äôt say this without a significant portion (and the majority of Reddit morons) disagreeing. It‚Äôs common sense, but this site is an echo chamber for all the radical nut jobs  who would rather push a broken ideology than follow logic and lessen awful events like this."
"Jesus! I‚Äôm sorry they need to bring back state hospitals and if people are a danger to self or others, bye! This can‚Äôt keep happening!"
He wasnt an Islamic terrorist though. He seemed to actually be very anti Islam and an AfD-suppporter who blamed Germany for letting too many muslims into Europe.
"They can bar entry, actually depending on the circumstances. Since they agreed to accept a ton of people this is the result. Smile you have egg on your face."
It's almost like it takes some time pull cameras and identify the suspect
They couldn't find the couch in their living room. Useless.

"Yeah we are legitimately monsters, look, we as a nation voted in trump, twice."
There were issues with it (though apparently not AS bad as believed - some of the studies were total BS) but it was definitely a situation where they threw out the baby with the bathwater.
"There was a serious re-evaluation of community mental health post-Vietnam and in 1980 the Mental Health Systems Act was passed, giving federal funding for the establishment of a large nationwide system of community mental health clinics. A year later that progress collapsed when newly-elected President Ronald Reagan's budget bill gutted the MHSA."
"And people try to do the same thing with correction facilities. ""Welp, they're full of abuse and putting people in jail doesn't solve the problem. Time to throw a bunch of these people on the street instead!"".

It's like err...there's an in between here."
"Agreed, the long term effects of closing those institutions outweighs the short term ‚Äúgains‚Äù people wanted. 

It affects EVERYONE."
"But they have the right to live in filth and harass everybody in the streets. Signed, Regan"
"I just don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs seen as compassionate, and why I was treated like scum for arguing for doing the hard, actually compassionate thing of helping them. How is it not the left wing position to bring back asylums and do them right?"
Just add it to the long list of shit the Reagan administration ruined.
"yea but look at some of the documentaries on some of the old places - it was brutal - most people would be better off on the streets then that shit - there was the occasional good one but most were hell holes 

And do to it right with proper care and oversight is a political nightmare/ suicide because of the massive modern cost. 

Its a catch 22 - screwed if you do / screwed if you dont however the ""hands off "" approach fully is what is nuts.  The fact the DA woudl rather let them go then ""waste time"" prosecuting for non violet stuff is nuts ."
Reddit loves to make this point but forgets a lot of those facilities were rape and torture machines. It‚Äôs basically just paying to make these people disappear.
Thank a Republican for that
"Oh yeah for sure. When I was in the psych ward for a mental breakdown this year it really put it in perspective for me. Like some people just cannot function. There was one girl that was 19 and she could not tell the difference between a 9 and a 6, yet they were trying to get her independent housing when she got out. As much as I am happy that she will have a place I just could not imagine this girl being out on her own. She wanted to sleep on my room because she was afraid of the dark. And there were other people too who were extremely violent or confrontational. But they weren‚Äôt bad people. Just very unwell."
"That's why just giving homeless people homes isn't sufficient. For the ""invisible homeless"", the ones who are mentally sound, work with the system, and are just down on their luck? Yeah, that works. For those who want treatement for their issues, and just need a stable accomodation while getting the help they need? Yup, works great too. More homes for those people please.

For those who are on the street because they're a danger to those around them and get kicked out of every pleace they try to stay, including homeless shelters? Nope, giving them homes won't do anything beyond hurting innocent people.

We need a net of solution tailored to individual situations.

You could add 1 million homes overnight to NYC and the homeless ""problem"" (the specific parts we're talking about in the news) wouldn't change at all, because the majority of those causing issues need more than just home. Of course, it would help a ton of people and that would be amazing. Just not those you hear about."
"Even the ones that are funded well largely don‚Äôt work because even the best asylum basically seems like torture to the family of the insane person. It‚Äôs just not something our political system solves well, the families care the most and dedicate their lives to yelling at elected officials about it in public hearings"
Forced institutionalization does always and will always look akin to torture from the outside and yet we have to do it anyway for the good of society
"No you are right, I am just being idealistic. But I feel like we have to come up with a better option than the streets or jail. Making health care more affordable and accessible would help a lot but some people can never be ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù"
"I understand what you're saying, but currently it's practically the same thing, right?"
Oh boy‚Ä¶  now this is the truth.
"Goddamn Newt and his toad friend, Mitch McConnell üôÑ"
A lot of families don't have the capacity to be caregivers for mentally ill family. They are working full time jobs and can't be nurse and social worker for people who often resist the help they need.
"I lived in SF and now live in LA and yeah it‚Äôs bad. I have to deal with a homeless person screaming on the street and scaring people almost daily, have had neighbors and friends who have been attacked, etc. I support liberal policies on almost every front except homelessness and mental health. The strategy seems to be offer services that none of them want to voluntarily use and I‚Äôm so tired of people saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs safer than it used to be so we‚Äôre doing a good job.‚Äù It is simply not safe and people are getting hurt/killed"
Damn that‚Äôs terrible. Sorry fr. That area is the definition on dystopia. Just wheels off. I bought an eightball from a guy I was referred to in front of a restaurant full of people. And as we left a woman in neon fishnet leggings was just out there. We were in like the heart of Hollywood.
Im from Baltimore. I didnt even know how aggressive homelessness could be until I went to CA. We have homeless here  in Baltimore of course but not nearly as much and they usually spread out.
"I went to visit a friend once. He lives in a new building. When the uber dropped me off the whole street was lined with tents and cardboard. Shit all the streets. Can‚Äôt blame em, weather is choice to be homeless."
"I love Boston. I went pre-Covid, and it was quite lovely. Subsequently went to LA and San Francisco, and there was a pretty stark contrast there. I went to the Santa Monica pier and it was wall-to-wall people, and as we walked to find some place to get ice cream, it got a bit sketchy. We actually abandoned the idea when the ice cream place didn‚Äôt have any AC. Didn‚Äôt seem right. San Francisco was even worse. Took an Uber into the city, and it looked really rough on the drive in. This was 4-5 years ago now though."
The curse of much of CA on the coast is nice enough weather so you can stay outside year-round without the sort of problems you encounter where summers get to 110F and winters drop below freezing.
"Wait until the Olympics, they‚Äôre gonna bus whole neighborhoods to other states like they did in Paris."
"Thank you for putting in a good word. Kind of over this LA and SF bashing. Sometimes I think these endless comments are just about maintaining the narrative that California=bad. There are 40 million people in California. Of course you are going to possibly see more homeless than other states.   
  
People from all over the country are coming to CA because of the weather and resources provided. Anecdotally I have spoken to quite a few homeless people who came from everywhere BUT CA. And not migrants, so that narrative can also die down. I agree about institutions, but for their safety and sanity, not ours. 

Our state taxes are going to care for what could essentially be considered a federal responsibility. Don't know how to fix that, but bashing these cities isn't it. Along with what the state also contributes to support other states.   
  
I am from SF and visits LA consistently. Are there problems, yes - as with any major metro. LA is a massive city with 13 million. Out of that there are \~46,000 unhoused people. Too many, but they are not everywhere like what is being said here. And so many times I talk to people visiting SF remarking how beautiful it is and not exactly what they hear about on TV."
"Well I didn‚Äôt mean every street has their own homeless clan lol. But I could be convinced they‚Äôre number one. I saw some impressive setups out there, shoutout to the homeless lol."
"Could it be a contributing factor that since COVID, people generally don't carry cash anymore? That could also be a resource drying up, albeit not one for psychiatric treatment."
It is weird.
"Arresting the guy the same day is about as well as law enforcement can handle a crime, right?"
"Yeah... that's simping for Mangione. Downvote me all you like, but this woman died tragically, but all we do is point out how Mangione was treated worse than this guy?

I mean if you want to simp for him, that's fine. Say it with your chest though."
"That's simping. You're using this woman's death to run defense for Luigi. If you want to simp for him, that's fine. Just own it."
"> woman got burned to death and the NY legal system reacted with a resounding ""meh""

They caught him less than a day later. Sounds like it worked as intended."
"Not to be the *WELL ACKSHULLY* guy but,‚Ä¶

Is it really that surprising that broad daylight hit-style murder of the ceo of a universally hated company is a bigger deal than than the (granted, depraved) murder of a rando homeless person on a train? 

I don‚Äôt think the race of the ceo or relative attractiveness of the killer in the mangione case really would have made that *less* of a big deal."
"""Meh""? They arrested the perpetrator the same day..."
"The cop was clearly going to get/do something, like get one of the many close by fire extinguishers. What did you want the cop to do? Bear hug her?"
"He literally didn't but ok. Let's ignore the MULTIPLE cops that did help, too. Gtfo with this bullshit, no cop is going to just ignore someone ON FIRE no matter how useless they've been in the last few years."
"I mean it does feel like that but realistically what were people even supposed to do? The cop was probably going to get the fire extinguisher and unless you have a bucket of water on you there is not much you can really do, its a person on fire that burned so much they are not even screaming anymore. She was dead even if they put out the fire that very instant."
Probably more due to shock than lack of humanity tbh.
"Sorry, I'm not into gore videos, so didn't search the web for video of the victim burning to death. 

If there actually was a passerby who shot cell phone video instead of screaming or helping, then yeah, that's disgusting.

But a passerby on the platform after the fact is not quite the same thing as a subway car full of people. I really think the assailant was alone in the car with the victim when he pulled out the lighter. Somebody would have grabbed the lighter away if this crime was attempted in front of people. There is a reason why people are told to ride in the conductor's car during off hours. It is definitely safer than being alone with a possibly violent lunatic."
What do you want people to do?
Where is the video?
Dang...I thought we taught our children about per-capita statistics on the coasts...where did you get your education? Not being mean/sarcastic.
"New Yorkers are very, very good at taking riding defensively and binding their business, which keeps them safe. If you've ridden hundreds of times, you likely do it automatically. If your avatar matches your real life gender, you're trained since you're a toddler to look behind your shoulder at all time.

You shouldn't have to, but it's how our society is. At this point it's just been normalized. Doesn't mean you're not in a dangerous situation on a daily basis."
[removed]
Damn‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been imagining shit for 37 years.  Wild.
"He didn't murder that scumbag he accidentally killed him in the defense of others, you might be too stupid to understand the difference but that's how it legally played out. This guy on the other hand attacked without reason unless you're insane enough you can justify stabbing two and immolating a third none of which appeared to be instigating or violent."
"\>You mean the guy who fucking also murdered a homeless person? And got away with it and is being touted around as a celebrity and hero? And you‚Äôre trying to get us to feel pity for him under the story of another potentially unhoused person murdered on the subway?

Do you mean the homeless person that was being aggressive and screaming at the passengers: ""I want food"" ""I'm not taking no for an answer"" ""I'm ready to go back to jail"" ""I'll hurt anyone on this train, I don't care"".

And that, had he been left to do as he intended and hurt people, we would then be here saying: ""why did no one do anything?"". Now that's insane."
I guess so. They say its bystander syndrome but thats not a good enough excuse to me. I seen a man hitting his wife at my work so i shoved him. I didn't lose my job but idk why others just watched it happen. Its fucking stupid to me.
NYPost had a report on this
May I remind you that the Republicans voted down the border bill?
What are you talking about? It‚Äôs in the CNN article this post links to.
"as for ""¬†international culture of ‚Äúfuck women, I like to see them in pain.‚Äù¬†"" I agree, but the only cure for it is moral education and no where does it better than western countries but if you guys keep import bad apples from my country for example a so called shithole, your women is going to suffer."
"I know that my  reply has some negative stink to it. I am angry, I am actually from a shit hole country and you guys just keep repeatedly import criminal from my country into yours. I love your westen country because I grew up watching and learning your culture mostly including the language and even the job I have now I only choose ones with western culture. but I can see it is dying and sure that you can say who I am to care but seeing people not helping the poor woman it reminds me of my own country and I dont want westen country to turn bad. at all."
"Short of declaring martial law, what are the circumstances in which a state governor can prohibit interstate travel?"
Would be a lot faster if someone straight up said ‚Äúofficer that‚Äôs the guy I saw him do it‚Äù. But of course no ever sees anything
I think the main problem is that there wasn't an alternative.  So you had people institutionalized who could have lived just fine in the community with support.  But in the process of helping those people they ignored the more severe cases.
"Its an epidemic that the US government and healthcare system decided to let the public deal with. They couldnt figure out how to actually help people and instead turned them out onto the streets.

The reality? Healthcare, insurance providers and prisons make a lot more money with this system."
yeah iirc it got revealed a few years ago several of the experiments were actively fraudulent. The rosenhan experiement is the one im thinking of
"Typical republican measures. Throw out what is in place with a promise of doing something different but never having a plan and never following through. 

There was supposed to be an increase in outpatient services, groups homes, etc but they never funded it. 

I have worked in acute inpatient psych for nearly two decades now. In my early days we got a fair amount of people who had been in residential for years and spent the rest of their lives homeless, in and out of the hospital and basically just suffering. I have heard stories of how they were bad, but also how they saved people‚Äôs lives."
"Yep, Reagan did a lot of damage to mental health care."
Damn it Reagan!
"Yup!

Made so many private for profit prisons with horrible track records and now act confused at how shit could have gone bad.

It‚Äôs really quite gross"
"*Reagan, if anyone needs to look it up. President Ronald Reagan, who is the author of gems like closing asylums nationwide, and deregulation of truth in media. He's pretty much responsible for the creation of our current state of ""news."" It used to be, before Ronnie, that anything reported as news had to be factual. Legally.

Also, there's a shit ton of medical drug advertising mess that Reagan handed everyone. He's why you're assaulted with ads trying to get you hooked on prescription drugs.

Also, most of his second term was run by his wife and cabinet. Ronald Reagan himself was busy succumbing to Alzheimer's.

Just say ""No!"" to drugs, kids. Eat some more Zoloft instead!"
"i truly believe mental hospitals were underfunded on purpose, so that one could point to how horrible they were so they would just close and save the government millions, billions. this is the conservative way."
I don‚Äôt think there is an inherent connection between long term mental institutions and rape/torture. Just because that‚Äôs how it happened previously doesn‚Äôt give us the right to throw up our hands and give up on people
Yeah and late 19th century maternal wards were death mills because the Drs weren't washing their hands and doing autopsies between births- but we seemed to figure that out without getting rid of maternal wards form hospitals entirely. I'm so over the apathy.
Sure were. Same as prisons. Google Marcy Correctional Facility in Marcy NY for a revolting incident from 2016 and now murder of a prisiner by gqurds just the other day.  That guy was handcuffed the whole time the guards were beating him to death.
"Frankly they need an alternative society to participate in since they can‚Äôt function in ours- that‚Äôs the ground truth. If the previous solutions had issues let‚Äôs find a new one, not say it‚Äôs too hard to solve.¬†"
"And also realistically once you get to the patients who are violent or very difficult to deal with, it's hard to find people who want to care for them even for a lot of money. That's why they end up drugged all the time - work conditions for those around them."
Kindda like schools who get sued by parents left and right even when they're doing sensible things.
"Yes, we certainly need solutions. Probably a bunch of different ones for all the different needs of the destitute and sick. I just really do not want to see more cruelty."
"The apathy is weaponised so the leadership, especially on the federal level, can continue to skate by without any accountability."
"Which is a part of the problem. When so many people in our society are over worked and underpaid they have less time and resources to care for their family members that need more support. Couple that with a lack of social safety nets, crumbling healthcare/mental healthcare infrastructure, and all the previously mentioned societal issues and it‚Äôs no surprise why we‚Äôre in the predicament we‚Äôre in."
"The mayor of SF encourages people to leave their cars unlocked so stuff can get stolen without having your windows smashed. I live less than 2 hours from San Francisco, my smallish town has sections that look like skid row. All of Target‚Äôs products are locked behind glass and homeless sneak up on you in the parking lot to ask for money."
Wait.. so your LA horror story is that the ice cream place on the pier didn't have AC? Wtf are you on about hahaha
"Maybe, but I feel like I stopped carrying cash at least since the early 2010's. I don't know how many people were still routinely carrying cash by the time covid happened."
"Completely normal to me too sorry üòÇ Different people from different locations may have different vocabulary,  I know,  crazy."
"Sure if you‚Äôre chronically online with no real world experience. üòê

Same energy as ‚ÄúNo, youRe oBvIOUsLy ThE oNlY onE wItH tHiS opInIOn.‚Äù In response to ‚Äúam I the only one who‚Ä¶‚Äù

It reads as ‚ÄúI have no idea how people actually talk and don‚Äôt get that not everything is literal.‚Äù

Edit: alright get mad at me and downvote me for yall being miserable about how regular people talk. Go touch grass."
"Again, it has nothing to do with how Mangione was treated. Many people have been shot where the mayor doesn't hold a press conference."
"Aren't you simping for the mayor and two percenters? Chest out, bro."
Move more quickly at the very least?
The cop i saw on the video literally looked then waved their hand like fuck that.
It‚Äôs on twitter. Easily findable. Also one of the most disturbing things I‚Äôve ever seen and I don‚Äôt shy away from disturbing videos
I saw it on the critical blunder sub. Its AWFUL.
"If it's still up, it's available on the kind of sites where people like to watch other people's deaths. There have been videos posted of people's bodies mangled by being struck by trains, or run over by semis. Why people want to look at that stuff is beyond anything I can fathom."
That‚Äôs what I was getting at with the comment I responded to. I went to a college in New York City.
I just exercise basic vigilance like anyone should anywhere. Just have situational awareness
"Exactly right. If we prosecute the good guys, don‚Äôt be surprised when no one steps in to stop the criminals. Such a backwards country."
"""It was bipartisan""

You do realize only a few people were involved in writing that bill and a vast majority of republicans disagreed with it hence why it was rejected. Just because somebody belongs to this or that party doesn't mean they're going to do a good job. Also like somebody else said that bill was disingenuous. If they really wanted to secure the border then they would have written a bill without a bunch of other bs attached to it. Also executive power could have been used to tighten border security but Biden's administration never did so."
May I remind you about all the other shit in that bill?
Because like all other bills it was filled with shit that had nothing to do with the border wall.
"Of course, the system was never perfect, but Jimmy Carter successfully pushed for the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980. It would have created and funded community mental health centers. In 1981 Ronald Reagan reversed the funding in the name of ""small government"" so he could increase the amount of money for The Department of Defense.  

""Anyone? Something D-O-O economics? VOODOO economics."""
"The system we have has a major shortage of mental health professionals as well. Whereas physical medicine started filling the gaps with PAs and NPs mental health still requires graduate degrees with state by state certification. It can take months or longer to even get into see a mental health professional, who might end up a bad fit. I‚Äôm not saying the system should fling the doors open to anyone regardless of training but something needs to be done about the lack of mental health professionals and access to them."
"I've lived in Canada, Australia and New Zealand and they all did the same thing as the US (close mental health facilities) despite not having the same for-profit privatised health care and prisons. That suggests it was more than just profit motivated, although still incredibly stupid in hindsight.

My home town of Vancouver has just as bad of a ""walking dead"" situation as any major US city."
Unfortunately it‚Äôs the same in Canada even with Universal healthcare.
"¬†It's not that they couldn't figure out how to help them, they just chose not to. The way to help them is funding. But Reagan slashed HHS' budget and left the most vulnerable people out in the cold"
They couldn't figure out how to actually help people *without spending money that doesn't create short term gains for capital shareholders*.
"
Yep, Reagan did a lot of damage."
probably had no idea what he was signing most of the time. We should say ‚Äúduring Regans term‚Äù or during ‚Äúobamas term‚Äù instead of believing a single individual is responsible. that leaves the pushers unaccountable.
"Honestly. We're also making these people exponentially worse because they're getting put into the prison system, which we know makes people more criminalistic and usually more violent. Its replacing any care with prison and roaming around with the public."
"You're right, but it's also important to remember why it happened. It's also almost like not being able to do those horrible things made that system worthless to many -- which is pretty fucked up too"
They're not saying throw up hands! They're saying it was BAD.
"Yeah people dramatically overestimate how treatable most mental illness is because the truth of the situation, that we just tank em up with drugs 24/7 without curing anything is depressing"
"Good grief that stinks! I‚Äôm sorry. We haven‚Äôt experienced that where I‚Äôm from yet, and hopefully never do."
"Haha no! The ice cream place was just the cherry on top of a crappy day. We walked for maybe 20 mins to get there through a sketchy neighborhood, and it kept getting sketchier as we walked. That was my main point- the feeling of safety wasn‚Äôt quite there. We did other things in LA too. Some good, some kind of meh. We saw the TCL Chinese Theatre, and walked around there. Again, a bit sketchy to be honest. But the Griffith Observatory was nice. Parking was absolutely horrendous though."
Then why are we talking about it here? There's been dozens of threads specifically dedicated to that topic. Why graffiti another woman's story by tying it to Reddit's favourite folk hero?
"Uhm, akchuly, sir, ERM, I've only said it about 5 times.

If you're going to be pedantic, be accurate at least. I used a colloquial definition that everybody understood, therefore, I used it correctly. 

Attack my argument or sit down."
Where did I do that?
It seemed to me like he was reaching for his radio thing on his chest/shoulder. The way the lady is so still at first made me think that she was already gone. Maybe people were assuming the same until she moved her leg üôÅ
How dare you tell the truth on reddit. The pitchforks are coming.
"It was literally bipartisan backed, but your ‚Äúdear leader‚Äù told them to vote against it."
My schizophrenic cousin from Vancouver was booted out of his group home when they changed things and spent his last days off his meds and on street drugs and died a while thereafter. It was heartless and stupid to throw everyone out on their asses when they had no chance of surviving. I guess my cousin's end was cheaper for health services than paying for a group home so I'm going to blame $$. Still bitter.
Germany is getting there too. Frankfurt and Bremen are nightmares.
"In the world for Van, yall are just as bad as ANY city in the world.

Easily the worst in Canada, and I come from Sask where we have #2 and #3."
Yeah. We know what to do. We are just choosing not to do it because it costs money and god forbid somebody's taxes go up by 0.1%
True. I remember he tried to do away with the National Standards Bureau too.
"Sure sounds like it‚Äôs an excuse not to care about these people, excuses that 50%+ of the population use to not care for their fellow humans"
I hope you never do either.
"It‚Äôs disgusting and bizarre what people are doing, reacting to any murder anywhere in the US with ‚ÄúwHeN tErRoR cHaRgEs?!?‚Äù"
"82 fireworks, 3 knives and no vibrators. Not quite ready to party, nothing worse then having to shop for supplies when you arrive at your destination"
2 replica of firearms... those are bottle opener keychain.
So *that's* what women keep in their handbags. I've always wondered
Damn she should‚Äôve taken a greyhound
God forbid a woman has hobbies...
"TSA really stretching for that win.  A pack of black cats, 3 pocket knives and some bottle openers is not news."
"*‚ÄúThis traveler should have followed TSA‚Äôs tried and true advice ‚Äî unpack your bag before you pack it to ensure you don‚Äôt bring any prohibited items to the security checkpoint. ""*

That's good advice for accidentally forgetting you have a small pocketknife in a pocket. I don't think if she had unpacked and repacked her bag she would've thought, ""Whoops, forgot those 82 fireworks were in here."""
"Those little firecrackers and 3 basic knives are the big catch? 

TSA. There are guns and drugs going right through under their noses every day. It's security theater and public harassment mostly. I want to believe they would catch an actual terrorist."
"I check every pocket 15 times before going to the airport, spending hours preparing everything.

This lady is like, ""fuck it. I'm good."""
That's probably below the average amount of explosives in the typical woman's purse in my experience.
"""Shit. I grabbed my mayhem backpack by mistake."""
"I got my prescription mouthwash taken away the other day. They sampled it and put it in a machine and it failed the test. They then called an EOD specialist to run more tests, which it failed. 

The skies are safer now from my chlorohexadine mouthwash."
An old box of firecrackers and some gun lighters. They caught a big one there!
"Why the fuck is this even news? Its just a bunch of firecrackers and shitty ass knives? All the shit happening on the other side of the planet and these loser reporters are getting paid to write bullshit like this.¬†¬†


Edit: not sure if the photo in the article is directly from the event because if it is thats is absolutely pathetic reporting. Replica firearms???? Those two little keychains? 'Senior reporter' man it must be easy to be a reporter slinging shit articles like that out...¬†"
üé∂ And a partridge in a pear tree.
Fellas will see this and just say ‚Äúhell yeah!‚Äù
"Not gonna lie, I kind of want to see how powerful ""Mighty Cracker"" fireworks are now."
"4 dozen fireworks 
3 sharp knives
2 replica firearms 
And a little pair of weird scissorssssss"
Alternate headline. Women surprised TSA actually found prohibited items.
"She just wanted to set off some fireworks for NYE, what's the problem?  /s"
"She was the Home Alone mom, going back to help Kevin boobytrap the house"
The Tomb Raider reboot apparently has an airport level now
I feel like the ‚Äú2 replica firearms‚Äù is a bit of a stretch in this case
"Fireworks, knives, did she accidentally swap bags with a 10 year-old boy who was running away from home?"
Looks like she threw the contents of a dutch in there too.
Damn fireworks from 1982? That was the high point of lethal fireworks.
"I'mma be real, whatever her plan was it was not going to succeed anyway. Would've been entertaining as hell though"
That means I can bring my fleshlight!
Go big or go home I guess.
Did she grab the wrong bag at home?
But the 12 pack of Keystone Light was no problem!
She is lucky she didn't meet a bomb sniffing dog.  And what is with the can opener handguns?  Looks like she got most of the don't do this shit when flying into one bag
"I feel like this is Santa's go-bag, minus a slew of passports of various nationalities

If he was a merry assassin, obviously"
Granny in front of me at the Lancaster County Courthouse had a small caliber automatic buried down in her purse when she was searched at the door.  The guard let her skate.  That was in the mid  1990s.
She was the distraction for the real smuggler
"Banned for flying, right?"
This is the stuff a 11 year old packs when told to pack a bag to go camping this weekend
My Baldurs Gate 3 inventory
That's not a terrorist TSA that's a redneck. I know it's hard for you to see the difference nowadays
"I used to travel for work, when on site I would use my carry on bag for my tools. I'd bring a ratchet screwdriver, a drill, box knives, and other stuff. 

Several times I forgot to move my knives back into my checked luggage and discovered them on the plane. Every single time that happened, TSA stopped my bag because of the few swallows of water left in my bottle, but never even registered my knives. 

The only ""security"" that ever caught it every time was the airports that used private TSA, not homeland TSA. You'll never convince me those smurfs are trained. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut every now and then."
These are considered stocking stuffers in Philly.
I get why you can‚Äôt take fire crackers but I feel like they‚Äôre a bit small to be considered fireworks
"‚ÄúHomer, I don‚Äôt know what you have planned for tonight, but count me out‚Äù"
"On the first day of travel, the TSA took from me‚Ä¶"
This *must* have been the woman trying to beat some record or something.
"Accidentally took my pocket knife to the airport a few months back. Put it in my wife's purse and wasn't noticed at all. 

Stupid security theater."
"Sounds like they're all treating this like an ""oopsie."" Why? This is kind of interesting. I would welcome the lessening of draconian over-response to innocent mistakes - but how would you know? The lady had enough explosives to potentially do significant airframe damage."
"Considering how often the TSA fails undercover screening checks, the only surprising thing here is that she was actually caught."
"Fuck the TSA. Their entire existence is just propaganda to remind us that terrorists exist, make us miss flights, and to steal from our bags."
Good work by the TSA for finding it.
"Wtf, that's an amount you'd use to down the plane too. 

Kudos to the X-ray operator"
Liquor and cigarettes are missing too.
"....Two replica firearms and a canister of pepper spray, 

And a pair of scissors."
"Of course it's company policy never to, imply ownership in the event of a dildo... always use the indefinite article ""a dildo"",  never ""your dildo"""

"Remember, Anything can be a dildo if you are brave enough‚Ä¶"

"it‚Äôs a dildo. Of course it‚Äôs company policy never to, imply ownership in the event of a dildo... always use the indefinite article a dildo, never your dildo."
And the 82 fireworks looks like a pack or two of firecrackers all separated out individually. It's like saying dozens of consumable drugs and it's a pack of cigarettes.¬†
I find it alarming the TSA believes that is a replica.  Have they only ever seen a picture of a gun?
How is this newsworthy?
"TSA got to justify their budget... Did they ever catch a bomb or defeat a terrorist plot, ever?"
Maybe she was going to try and intimidate [Bullet Tooth Tony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgBA1jA2-mo)
"I bought one at a gas station because it said ""I don't dial 911"" once when I was working as a 911 dispatcher. Was my bottle opener on my desk for years."
Good work by TSA for finding it all.
Only the cool ones...
"We took a night Amtrak once between San Antonio and Austin. 

Old guy in front of us had just been released from jail. He was on a burner cell phone talking to a buddy, plotting revenge‚Ä¶

Young guy across the aisle had a giant canvas bag full of pills. We only knew it was full of pills because they kept spilling out. He spent half of the trip scuffling around on the floor gathering spilled pills."
The toughest baggage questioning I‚Äôve ever went through was the time I had the nerve to try and take a tea-strainer onto a Greyhound. The inspector had never encountered loose leaf tea before and seemed convinced it was some sort of drug paraphernalia instead.¬†
"They missed the Claymore Mine.      
‚ÄúFRONT TOWARDS ENEMY‚Äù confused them."
"You jest, but I can remember a time when my friends would fly to North Carolina for a few weeks and come home with fireworks, knives and even guns in their luggage. 

Traveling didn‚Äôt used to be a frisk down."
You forgot the toenail clippers.
"Those don't look like black cats. Are they? If so, I retract my other comment about potential explosive damage."
It was just a single box of firecrackers but they counted them individually
"It would be hilarious if she's been carrying this stuff through TSA for years, adding one firecracker each time, and it took this long for them to notice."
theater of security
Hell yeah
"Cousin Stumpy says they're pretty good. He does recommend using an extra-long punk to light them, though."
Small caliber automatic! What was she packing an Uzi?
Let me get one of those disposable enemas.  You know what make it two.
"If they wanted to liquor, then the vibrator might not be necessary."
‚ÄúReplica firearms.‚Äù Or as everyone else calls them: keychains.
TSA approved scissors from the look of it.
"Throwers don't worry about ticking because modern bombs don't ""tick""..."
"Those Mighty Cracker things apparently sell for about $3.50 for a 100 count box. (Not familiar with them, quick curious Google). It's a partial box of one inexpensive item. This is absolutely not what I imagined when I scrolled by that headline earlier!"
Good thing she didn‚Äôt have any sandwich baggies they would have charged her with intent to distribute.
It's like saying they had 1000 rounds of ammo and it's a single bulk box of .22LR.
"That‚Äôs actually what they did,I a believe it lol.

Actually I can believe it."
"That‚Äôs actually what they did,I cant believe it lol.

Actually I can believe it."
"You mean a replica firearm? Yes, they‚Äôve seen plenty /s"
"Probably, it‚Äôs not like they manage to stop the real ones from getting through considering their failure to detect rate is between 80-95%."
A picture of a gun would also be considered a replica to them
TSA needs a win so the horror stories about their abuses during the holiday season get ignored
"Lot of people traveling this week, TSA thinks this makes the masses feel 'safer' if they announce they found something rather than all the stuff they definitely missed."
yeah amtrak is great but one of the downsides is that it does tend to attract some interesting clientele who cannot fly
I would travel to MA for bulk weed all the time in college and loved the lack of security on the Amtrak. My BIL (police officer) did a two day trip in coach across the country and said he saw some real sketchy characters on there lol. I didn‚Äôt tell him my story but I fully believed what he said he saw lol.
"As a tea drinker nerd, this is wild. But I guess it doesn't surprise me."
"And now they take away things like my mini bathroom scissors (I am still salty about that)

"See you got the snakes and sparklers but wheres the good stuff? 

Joe Dirt‚Äôe is not impressed."
"They are probably a different brand, but look like tiny little fire crackers that you can get at most fireworks stands.¬†


I mean, I get it... If they were combined they could be dangerous but it still seems like they are trying to oversell the find by counting each one.¬†"
They look like m80s
Idk if I should say this but for several years I had about 4 of those exact same firecrackers stuck down in the pocket of my backpack. I don't fly much but had probably been on a dozen flights with that bag and it was never once caught despite them pulling me over for other things like electronics.
I don‚Äôt know what you have planned for tonight but count me out.
"No, what make it two?"
"Yea they're basically like 1/10th of an M80 if even that. As a kid they're fun to put in puddles and watch pop up, or in ant hills or whatever.¬†


I remember constantly having a supply of these when I was around 10 or so"
I just wanna add that those rates come from when they test themselves. It‚Äôs like failing an open book test about how to open a book.
At least they are keeping deadly tubes of toothpaste from getting onto a plane.
\*finger gun\* give me all your money!
"‚ÄúLook how amazing we are‚Äù 
We inconvenienced one moron and marginally protected others."
"Yeah, we were visiting from Canada. We took the train because we thought it would be nice and not too scary."
this is really far from the northeastern train experience it's crazy... I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's that different for the various areas of service
"Don't try and church it up, son."
"M-80s have been banned for sale to the public since the 60's, and are much bigger (80 grains of flash powder, or 5.2g). These are probably m-5s or smaller."
"A M80 had 80 grains (5.2 grams) of flash powder. A modern cracker is limited to 50 mg of powder.  So actually 104 times less powerful.

It is like 3 dollars worth of water crackers there"
"Took it from Milwaukee to Denver. Not sleeping for 26 hours on top of the no sleep before was an experience I will never do again. Slow as shit, shakes a lot and yeah."
"you‚Äôre more likely to get it on the long across-the-country type routes. for those smaller inter-city needs most people have family/friends willing to drive to pick them up.

i met a guy who just got sprung from chicago MCC and rode the empire builder with him all the way to his stop in north dakota (i was going all the way to seattle)"
"Seconding this. I practically lived on Amtrak for four years going back and forth to college in the Northeast, and while it was definitely more chill than taking a plane, some of these stories are nuts. I was a very sheltered kid coming out of high school who was sketched out by city buses, but never had a problem on the trains."
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I hope the customer service doesn‚Äôt suffer. It‚Äôs one of the last retailers that I can count on for helpful staff and easy returns.

Plus they price match on the spot if you pull up your phone and show a cheaper price for the item!"
This is a good thing. By going private they can focus on sustainable growth long term instead of pleasing shareholders. There will probably be some overhauls with the designer lines to be more flexible with changing consumer tastes and they'll swap out products much faster without the bloated bureaucracy that slows public business decision making.
"Apparently, they actually tracked down the [used tire story](https://press.nordstrom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nordy-pod-truth-about-nordstroms-legendary-tire-story) and it's true."
Don't get the hate from nordstrom. Used to work for them and of the retail jobs i had they definitely treated employees the best and paid pretty well.
Glad the Nordstrom family finally got off the rack
Nordstrom - a good Mexican name!
Yo Nordstrom we heard you like some Nordstrom  in your Nordstrom and then we added a little more Nordstrom  just because!
Why don't they name the Mexican retail group by name? (Liverpool)
Wow what a crazy coincidence that a family with the last name Nordstrom is going to acquire Nordstrom stores! Are they just doing it because of the last name?? Great story!
first order of business is to get rid of that awful OnTrac delivery service! not only did they not attempt to a delivery but it's been 3 days and the gift is showing Delayed. This is freakin ridiculous.
Finally corn on a stick next to the clinique counter.
"Ah should have guessed Liverpool is the mexican company acquiring it. 

Prepare for everything to be overpriced, and for them to offer 0% interest payment plans on everything."
‚ÄúMexican Retail Group‚Äù. Cartels.
"OK, so we don't have Nordstrom in NZ (that I am aware of?) but I've seen enough material on the internet showing some of the stupid stuff they sell for stupid money, that I'm pretty sure they're the store that you only shop at to show you're rich and want everyone to know it via conspicuous consumption.

Therefore, is this article looks to me, like an attempt by the Nordstrom family conspicuously flexing their wealth by buying their own stores back?

I am probably wrong? But holy hell, I doubt I'll ever have enough money or desire to buy any of their shit."
This is a good thing. They will no longer be vulnerable to private equity.
That seems way too easy to abuse.... Throw an extension onto Firefox on your phone and have it adjust prices for you lol.
It‚Äôs amazing how well any company would do today if they just focused on customer service
Why on earth would that suffer when the family that made it the signature of their brand are assuming more direct control?
"I worked at a distribution  center from 2018 to the end of 2020. Their return policy is the best of any clothing business. You can have an item for up to one year and still return it for at least most of the money spent. Also, i dont shop at nordstrom because it is largely like an expensive goodwill. I used to be in every department in the warehouse. In receiving, there was a time where i was sent there to remove the tj maxx tags of winter coats and replace them with pricier nordstrom tags."
"Nitpick : You still have to please shareholders. 

It‚Äôs just that in that specific case you only have two of them instead of an invisible multitude. 
If those two want long term growth instead of short term results then yes. But that is not a guarantee"
Worked at Nordstrom briefly while in college. I remember this story being told during training sessions
I wonder how much that associate is worth today.
Worked there was told this story during management training
Sounds like Nordstrom got scammed and their poorly worded policy cost them. LOL no way that nonsense is happening today.
Who‚Äôs hating?
"I worked for them too, good benefits, if you‚Äôre in sales you can make a decent wage off commission. Only issue was the culture"
"Interestingly, a lot of sales during the anniversary sale end up going to Mexican families in Mexico (at least from 361 in La Jolla).   People who work there especially in the women‚Äôs shoes department would have tens of thousands of dollars of shipments each anniversary sale.  And made a big difference on the bottom line for Nordstrom‚Äôs and I‚Äôm not surprised that‚Äôs the secondary financer they brought in."
"Without looking it up I assume it was started by some Swedish guy or guy with Swedish heritage, who just anglicized his last name?"
"I mean, it was enough for Armand Hammer to buy Arm & Hammer."
"The Nordstrom family started the business here in Seattle, my guess is that at some point they sold some or all of it and are buying it back. My company has built a lot of their family homes and from what I hear they are decent enough for super wealthy clients so this seems like probably a good thing for the company. I only shop Nordstrom Rack every once in awhile so it probably won't change much for me unless they decide to build more houses at some point.¬†"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Hammer#Stake_in_Arm_&_Hammer
This! I‚Äôve had to reach out to customer service for multiple orders when there has been a ‚Äúfailed attempt at delivery‚Äù for no apparent reason. Interestingly enough they always end up being delivered the same day that I reach out. Almost like there was no reason for it not to be delivered in the first place lol. OnTrac is literally the worst
"I used to work there and they supported me through college and grad school- first priority on schedule as a student, really good health care and benefits, and a generally really fun environment to work in. Their big thing was empowering employees so they could do whatever in the name of customer service. I have vivid memories of using my time on the clock babysitting a UPS driver over the phone so they could make a delivery of a bridesmaids dress the day of a wedding. It used to be an incredible company to work for and that was something they were proud of. They went public and everything went to shit, from product to people. That's why the Nordstrom brothers want to buy it back, or say they want to buy it back. 

It's no different from any other department store now. Hopefully they'll get some of their old mojo back."
I‚Äôm not rich by any means but have put based a lot of stuff at Nordstroms. It is high end but pricing is similar to other retailers but they have INCREDIBLE service.¬†
"Nordstrom is expensive, but I'm not sure what stupid stuff you're referring to... It's a high end department store. And their return policy is really generous, which is why it's chosen by a lot of people."
I go to Nordstrom Rack to buy discount shoes
"Nordstroms sells things across multiple price brackets.  You can find high dollar items and you can find things marked down like kids shoes for $20.

The Nordstroms family took the company private because the company's financial performance has been on a downward trend since 2018 and made a few questionable investments (eg. expanding into Canada).  If Nordstroms remained a public company, its earnings would likely dip negative again, violate some debt covenants, maybe then go into bankruptcy, and probably go through restructuring.  Taking the company private skips some of this headache so the company can fix its revenue issues.

Side note - taking the company private is hardly ""flexing"" anything.  It's an admission they suck at management and need to pay out shareholders before creditors / lenders get involved"
"Nordstrom is just an upscale department store with surprisingly good customer service. It's not a monument to conspicuous consumption, just a place to shop if you're (upper) middle class. If you have fuck you money you have a personal shopper, or one of your assistants does your shopping for you. For the record, just about every store has a department that sells useless shit. You can get junk at Dollar Tree / the pound shop."
"Eh, they closed the one nearest to me.  For the market they were cost wise closer to specialist retailers, but not out of line with competitors for cost.

You need to want to pay for the difference between a $40 and $100 button down shirt for it to be worth it.  But some of it was nicer (but also worse selection than specialist retailers, for men anyway.  So I wouldn‚Äôt go there).

Some of their dresses were nicer too, but it seemed like they also pushed in the prom direction more than the more traditional 50+ year old women group."
You are taking about Bergdorfs and to a smaller extent Neiman Marcus. Nordstroms is for cities too poor for a Neimans.
"It‚Äôs about the same as a Dillard‚Äôs, but they offer more higher priced designer items along with everything else.  Neiman Marcus is fancier/more expensive.  Not as cheap as Macys.  

I hope it doesn‚Äôt change much.  We don‚Äôt have one nearby, but I shop online a decent amount per year.  I just returned something I had forgotten about that I had for like 2+ years.  It was a pair of girls jeans that didn‚Äôt fit my daughter."
It‚Äôs basically just a macys or any other generic department store
"We refer to them as the ""Temple of Conspicuous Consumption"" in my family. We're from Seattle, the store's birthplace. My grandparents and parents often shopped there. Good products and good customer service.¬†


I get most of my ties for work there, sometimes shoes, etc., but really we don't spend much time at the Temple, anymore. You can get many of the same items for far less elsewhere.¬†"
Private equity can 100% go after private companies
yeah cuz private equity bought them out lmao
"Because public ownership is so much better right? It‚Äôs either private ownership or be stuck following the whims of public shareholders making everything worse in the pursuit of more profit every quarter. You people sound like fucking parrots simply repeating someone else‚Äôs tired lines.

Private ownership is not inherently bad, there‚Äôs just bad people."
It‚Äôs from specific retailers.
Guy really said the company being acquired by private equity is somehow no longer vulnerable to private equity
"I remember getting Sears to price match a 3D TV based on a Fry's deal of the day that was out of stock everywhere. We're talking a 70%+ price difference on the most advanced 3D TV at the time. The Sears manager wasn't in the store at the moment so one of the sales reps had to call and the manager talked them through what steps they'd need to take to verify that the price match could be honored. One of the prerequisites was it HAD to be in-stock at one of the local Fry's, which the website luckily showed it was, but their site hadn't been updated to reflect the fact that they were actually sold out. So the rep called the local Fry's to confirm that it was in stock and ended up being put on hold for long enough that the Sears manager who was also waiting on the other line for an update to approve or reject the price match, couldn't wait on the phone anymore so they approved the deal based solely on what Fry's site was showing. I remember one of the supervisors from the neighboring department who got involved with getting the TV out of the warehouse to ring up told me that he wouldn't have approved the deal and everyone involved looked genuinely shocked that I was able to get away with such an insane price match."
Haha I‚Äôm not that sophisticated. üòÇ
"Not really.

In the Australian context 20-30% off is pretty much the everyday discount.  So if a customer asks for that range, don't really care if its real or not.  Depending on the brand, it might extend to 40.

Any higher, we will probably be pulling out our phones to take a look etc, and frankly its very rare that is any more than what the typical discount range is.  No one is out there to lose money, and most retailers have their prices and specials around the same ball park, and you quickly learn the typical range.

Its pretty rare to have a true loss leaders these days, and if there are products that might look like loss leaders, they are definitely specifically bought in for that exact purpose.  So they probably store exclusives or similar."
"When I worked for Best Buy in college the procedure was to validate the price myself on my phone or a store computer before matching it

The occasional ""customers"" who would either try that funny business or show me a fraud grey market website price and freak out about ""false advertising"" when we'd decline to match those prices were always fun"
That‚Äôs wild! Wow.
Also worked there in college and they told this one too
"Must be worth hundreds, if not thousands of dollars"
"Worked at Nordstrom for several years and that wasn‚Äôt the case at all. It was an opportunity to build a name and have a story told for 100 years. My first year in 2012, my department returned a bunch of tights from Wal mart for known scammers. Not to be a corporate boot licker but they‚Äôre one of the few companies to honor their word and respect their customer blindly. I modeled my company‚Äôs cs model after theirs and it‚Äôs been our greatest strength."
"The investment group partnering with the family is Mexican, not the Nordstroms (who are from Washington)"
On the vendor side they actually care and want a relationship with their suppliers.  They like new brands to thrive and take time to ensure they have a chance to compete.
"That's really interesting, and thank you for taking the time to explain and inform me on the history etc. that I was not aware of, since I'm not American."
"I'm referring to things like pre-faded and ripped jeans for like USD $800 and things like that.
I can't provide links to any of the things I'm referring to, but they stuck in my mind because of their ridiculous pricing for what I would consider to be ridiculous items."
Macy's doesn't look like they sell anything and also doesn't look like they receive new stock lol
Macys doesn't exist outside of the US (and related territories) and other generic department stores wouldn't be like Nordstroms...
"Yes, but now they have to get the Nordstrom family to sell to them, rather than just having to buy up a public stake.


Before private equity didn't need permission, now they do."
Private equity can go after any company.  What‚Äôs your point?
It‚Äôs the family buying it with a secondary group.  It‚Äôs not like a standard private equity transaction where they‚Äôre gonna throw a ton of debt on it and hollow up the company. The whole point is the family wants to control it again which they couldn‚Äôt when it was a public company.
"The company I work for was bought by private equity 6 years ago. We all refreshed our resumes and started job searching. Many of us never left though, and it has turned out to be one of the best things that could have happened to the company, and us. Private equity gets a bad rap because of the cases that make headlines, but not all investors are evil."
"Years ago when Sears was in its death throes, their website was having an aneurysm or something and had stuff priced wildly under what it should have been. Like the NSMB Mario Wii U bundle for $60. I decided to see if I could get Walmart to price match.

I went to the run down shitty one where I knew employees didn't give a fuck. Asked the young lady in electronics if she'd be willing to price match. Said sure. Rang it up and it obviously needed CSM approval. He came over, said ""Wow. Great deal"" and turned his key.

 I also got a couple Wiimote+s at Best Buy for $5 due to that."
That's awesome! I'm definitely buying my next 3D TV at Sears!
"Just inspect and edit elements!

Why did your department do that?
Was indeed a Swedish guy who moved to the US and anglicized his name
"As for the rest of the commenters downvoting me to hell because I am not aware of all things American, prey you don't come to New Zealand and make any comments about NZ based on what you've seen on the internet, or else I won't be as polite as u/[chartreusepapoose](https://www.reddit.com/user/chartreusepapoose/) was to me and who actually took the time to explain politely what the actual case is.

Which is not unlike when I visited the US in 1993 for my sisters wedding and had people asking me if we have indoor toilets, or electricity in NZ. I kindly explained, without trying to make them feel stupid, that yes, NZ is a modern country with indoor plumbing, electricity and all sort of modern things. The irony was that I was actually the only person at the wedding that had a cellphone, as they were not all that common back then.

In the meantime, I'm going to bask in my downvotes and go and hunt some hobbits.

Merry Xmas."
"They stock a wide range of items from middle of the road to high-end designer. Those crazy items are from high-end designers that also sell those same items at more exclusive stores. Nordstrom isn't marking them up on their own like that, they're just making them more accessible to a wider audience."
Are you the designated authority on fashion?
"Some people like that stuff and can afford it, if there's a market for it someone's going to produce and sell $800 ripped jeans"
"Nordstrom also only has stores in the US, what's your point?"
Nordstroms isn‚Äôt high end. It‚Äôs just a generic department store.
The person above said they wouldn‚Äôt be vulnerable to private equity if they weren‚Äôt a public company. That‚Äôs not true.
"> Years ago when Sears was in its death throws

Just so you know, it is death throes."
"> I went to the run down shitty one where I knew employees didn't give a fuck. Asked the young lady in electronics if she'd be willing to price match. Said sure. Rang it up and it obviously needed CSM approval. He came over, said ""Wow. Great deal"" and turned his key.

WOW! THAT'S A LOW PRICE!!!!

That's friggin hilarious though lol."

"3D experiences seemed to come and go every 30 years or so, but with VR/AR being as good as it is today, there's really not a compelling enough reason to make dedicated 3D movies or displays anymore. Watching Dredd 3D was the best!"

"we used to do that with concert tickets at our local venue. if we saw some  seats werent sold, we would edit our ticket to that seat. like a free seat upgrade. only few times we had to vacate seat because someone did buy ticket in between time we got from home to venue."

"The poster literally said they live in New Zealand and they aren't aware of any Nordstrom locations in NZ so they were trying to figure out what its like, to which the person I was replying to said it's like a Macys - which also doesn't exist in NZ.

It's wild that both me and the New Zealander are being downvoted when virtually anyone can go to [https://www.google.com/maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and see that the US isn't the World's only country."
it's middle to high end. source: shop there frequently.
They are a factor less vulnerable following this‚Ä¶
I was joking. Buying obsolete format at an obsolete store.
Would you consider it higher end than any other department store? It‚Äôs certainly not something where someone should feel like they may never be able to afford any of their products lol.
I know. Fry's is fried. Sears is sayonara. The TV crapped out too.
Drug use and sex with minors violates more than just state laws
Did he own a gun at the time? Because that‚Äôs a felony
Nothing unexpected. Now we just gotta hope Gaetz keeps his word and starts dropping info on other Republicans in retaliation.
"""sex with a minor""... Statutory rape. He raped a child. This headline is using weasel words to make it sound better."
"A pedophilic drug user?

Republican voters: Yes, please."
"Nothing will happen, he won‚Äôt be held accountable."
Guilty of all that shit but they didn‚Äôt*prosecute due to lack of evidence?
I really love how the federal government is acknowledging that Gaetz had sex with a minor and still refuse to publicly call for state and or federal charges to be brought against him. Meanwhile someone gets caught with weed on them and they could be looking at a life sentence. The justice system is a complete and utter failure
"Gaetz‚Äôs Florida constituents didn‚Äôt mind one bit, and in fact, voted him back in knowing all of this."
Please don't forget that this man was Trump's first pick to run the DOJ. Gaetz deserves all the scrutiny he gets but the spotlight was turned on him because he was initially a horrible choice to run the US justice department
"(This is in response to a now deleted comment which read, in part, ""Both sides turn a blind eye to this type of stuff"")

""Both sides""? Really?

Point out a Democrat who is a known pedophile. C'mon. I'll wait.

The evidence says you're wrong. The number of criminal charges is vastly higher among Republicans than Democrats. If we assume that both sides are turning a 'blind eye', then convictions are a small percentage of the total number of scumbags. 

That leaves us with two options: either Democrats are getting charged at a far lower rate than Republicans, or Democrats are much less tolerant of blatant evil and are much better at weeding out the truly bad apples from their own party.

Well, which is it?

I think the answer to this one is super obvious; the Republican party has been *positively rabid* about trying to make Democrats look evil in recent years. The way they targeted Hunter is a perfect example - the 'witness' they used to link him to crimes of any substance (beyond owning a gun - which just makes me cackle every time a Republican brings it up) is now being charged with lying to the FBI (a federal crime) because nearly everything he told them about Hunter's ""illegal business dealings"" is a lie.

Look back at Hillary. What was the 'great mistake' that Republicans charged her with? A private email server. The charge was so minor that the FBI ultimately declined to prosecute because they knew she would settle for a slap on the wrist. Yet the Republican base was positively rabid to 'lock her up'.

No, the Republican party has been grasping at straws to try and make Democrats look evil in order to justify their own corruption. ""Everybody does it"" is a piss poor excuse, but the cover it offers is just enough that everyone looking for a reason to ignore their blatantly disgusting behavior can shrug about it and pretend that they aren't enabling the very moral decay they pretend to be in such a panic about.

The Republicans voted for an adjudicated Rapist and Felon, one who led an insurrection, who coordinated a months long campaign to overturn an election, who consorts with White Supremacists and uses the rhetoric of hatred. They voted for him despite all of that, making it perfectly clear that they don't give a *shit* about 'moral character'.

Is it any surprise, then, that their party is filled with people who are reprehensible? After all, the voters have made it perfectly clear that they don't see it as an issue.

And it isn't like Gaetz is the only *outstandingly* scummy character Republicans have had to cover for.

Or have we forgotten George Santos?"
"It‚Äôs also a felony but yknow, that‚Äôs most of the GOP anyway"
"Oh well, I guess there's nothing that can be done."
"Would you look at that, Trump‚Äôs first pick for AG was a pedophile rapist all along . Trump is really fighting evil like that Christians nationalist said he would"
So his illegal activities were proven by a Congressional inquiry and he hasn't been charged?
Grand Old Pedophiles just love those little young voters!
"The other day, I heard Gaetz say ""*it's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank, and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now*"". 

Note that some of these occurrences took place in 2017 & 2018. Just six or seven years ago."
"It really is amazing how many white men, both in and out of political power (especially from my early career experience in the NYC financial sector, specifically the printing area before PDFs blew up) are heavy drug users but were all for making sure Black and other non white people got locked up for being user.


I had so many white men who would regularly just openly talk about doing drugs, while my Black ass had family members living in the projects with me who would get arrested for simplying having weed on them in the 90s.¬†"
Can you guess which news outlet is currently NOT showing this bombshell on their website??
"Poor guy had to pay 12 women $90,000 to have sex with him.  Couldn‚Äôt just go to the bar or swipe? 

And the minor he only paid $400!"
so he needs to be in JAIL
"Wow, can‚Äôt wait to see nothing happen since he‚Äôs a major supporter of the guy that‚Äôs allowed to do anything because he bullies people conservatives don‚Äôt like."
"Wait let me get this right, we have proof this man is a pedophile, coerced minors to engage in sex acts, and he gets a free pass with no charges because he‚Äôs Trumps buddy?

This entire society is just gross anymore. I‚Äôm so tired of criminals getting a pass while good people die everyday from shit healthcare, or putting their lives on the line for this country. We need to redraft the social contract."
"This might be a very dumb question, but what was the point of an ethics report if even after you find crime you do nothing?"
"Next time conservatives tell you that every accusation against their ruling elites is a ""political witchhunt"", remind them of this"
Now he's going to run for Senate so he can somehow vindicate himself.  It makes no sense.
"Why is he still free? 

Oh Yeah, our next president is a convicted felon and rapist too."
"‚ÄúThe Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,‚Äù the 37-page report concludes."
So normal republican behaviour then?
"If the person who was in the running for Attorney General was this dirty, it makes one think that all members of higher government should be looked into regardless of party or position. And unless people like Gaetz are actually held accountable for their actions, all this will do is continue to erode the people‚Äôs faith in their higher institutions. Crossing fingers that something tangible actually comes from all of this."
So a rapist and child molester like trump.
"I'm so sick of headlines like this.  

He raped a child.  He's a goddamned pedophile and should be routinely beaten by the other felons in prison."
"Jail.

This.

Fucking.

Rapist.


Holy Christ; How fucking difficult is this concept?"
Dude is a child rapist.¬† ¬†You don't have sex with minors.
"‚ÄúDrug use and sex with a minor broke the state laws‚Äù

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.., ya don‚Äôt say"
What is with these milque toast descriptors?! He's a rapist!!!
Looks like it's time for Gaetz to start naming other Republican congressional scandals...
"""the state finds 'sex with a minor' to be illegal"". I'm glad that was cleared up!"
"Im not even American but I find the excuse that these were things he did in his 'bachelor days' but he's a different person now unbelievable. Uh, if someone has THAT bad of judgment in their 'younger' days (he only got married a few years ago) I would assume he's not exactly virtuous now. Past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior.

ps. What the heck is wrong with the selection process that the US cant find a normal hard working guy, happily married, with decent values?"
So if congress investigates him and sees evidence of sex crimes why are they not passing on those findings for prosecution.   Why were they burying this report in the first place
And the chances are he‚Äôll end up in government. The US is a failed state‚Ä¶.
I'm sure the authorities in Florida will get right on this.
"Tax dollars at work funding pedo orgies! Cool! Good job, MAGA!"
"In other words, perfectly qualified for the trump administration."
And Garlands DOJ decided to not pursue the case. Justice is a joke in America.
How does someone have sex with a minor and not goto jail? This is absurd.
Cannot be overstated enough that Trump‚Äôs team knew all of this *and still nominated him for Attorney General and continued to support him after these facts were made public*.
Worst day of his life. So far.  I wish someone would indict him for statutory rape.
"What needs to be done, is the govt needs to come out and say why he's not charged. Why he's not arrested and facing trial. What they need to do is come out and tell us that there actually is two different levels of justice system. This way we can hear it from the horses mouth itself. 

Every politician who has broken the law that would have landed the most avg person behind bars for years is free or paid a minor penalty. We could probably take most of their communications off line by flooding them with robo calls and emails to start acting like they're elected officials that represent the people, not themselves. 

  
But tis nothing more than wishful thinking."
Throw this feckless fuck in jail just like everyone else in the Republican Party
"45 and epstein raped a 13 year old.

Birds of a feather flock together. ü™∂"
"Wait.. Raping someone, especially a minor, is against the law? Next you are gonna tell me that water is wet."
So why didn't Garland charge him?
"Didn‚Äôt Marjorie say she‚Äôd out everyone in Congress as punishment if this got released? 

I don‚Äôt care what their political affiliation, if it‚Äôs a serious crime, out them fools!!"
"And he'll be free to continue this disgusting behavior,  but don't worry guys! We have higher things to focus on... like what will the CEOs do? How can we protect the top 1% of the population from all us savages in the bottom 99%?! Whatever will we do? The oligarchy must stand! /s"
He didn't have sex with a minor. Minors cannot consent to sex with an adult. He raped her.
"There is only ¬´rape of a minor¬ª. 
There is NO ¬´sex with a minor¬ª.  
Minors have no consent to give cause they‚Äôre MINORS!!!!"
By sex with a minor do we mean RAPE?  Because it‚Äôs RAPE and every time I notice how it doesn‚Äôt say RAPE I‚Äôm like huh it should say RAPE instead of trying to sidestep it.
Pretty sure the right thinks sex with a minor should be punishable by death.
"Yeah so put him in jail and not a representative of the people, because I dont want any pedophiles representing me!"
So he's a proven pedo. I'm sure he will be spending Christmas in a jail cell....... any time now ......
Anyone who won‚Äôt admit there are two completely different sets of rules in this country are either fucking morons or are benefiting from the better set of rules.
"Wow. He broke the law?  
Is there something we traditionally do with people who violate the law?

Someone help me out here, I feel like there's something we do with people who violate the law but I can't remember what it is, because otherwise it would be happening."
">Matt Gaetz ethics report says his drug use and sex with a minor violated state laws

Specifically stated as such since the Federal law makers can't/won't do shit about it."
he is the same asshole who wanted recipients of food stamps and unemployment benefits to be drug tested first...shameless hypocrites
US laws are not for the wealthy.
"I guess one of two things could happen.

1. He becomes a pariah and faces legal consequences.

2. He enjoys a boost in support from Republican voters and nothing happens to him.

I know which of these will happen. This country is beyond saving. The stupidity was allowed to flourish for too long."
And Trump wanted to name him attorney general! Probably knowing full well what the report said. Fucking joke
Gaetz following in trumps footsteps. I guess he doesn‚Äôt realize only Trump can get away with this stuff.
"So, why is this guy not in jail? Would any regular citizen found to be using drugs and paying to have sex with a minor be collecting a $200,000+ salary from the government?"
Wow. Shocked. Now fry his rapist ass.
Did he also have conversations with Putin or was that just Trump and Elon. I get all these criminal acts so mixed up when nothing is done about them.
And he almost became the AG.
"Republicans have a record of supporting people like this. 
This is why conservatives get shunned"
"But when a republican trafficks underage girls and does illicit drugs, isn't it a little folksy? Instead of all those bad libs!"
Florida protects their own.
No way! Drug use AND sex with a minor is illegal? Holy fuck what a surprise.
"He‚Äôs a Republican, so it fits ‚ùóÔ∏è"
"Only the ‚Äúbest‚Äù people, amirite? Buckle up for the next few years smh."
"So weird watching all those ""shoot your local pedophile"" guys supporting and defending this rapist ü§∑ 

But well they somehow still believe those guys will somehow care about their shitty lives when in power I guess"
Yea I guess that's one of those things that you can't just ignore even for Trump. Insane that he thought he could become AG with that hanging alive his neck.
So when will he be arrested?
‚ÄúSex with a minor‚Äù is a wild description when you think about it for even a second
"Ah yes the law at work, where we establish that someone (rich or in the government) definitely broke the law and definitely raped a minor but definitely won't end up in prison for it because they definitely aren't a pleb lol those suckers always go to jail not us amiright"
"Remember, they tried to bury this. They didn't want you to see this.

Everyone knew it. Trump wanted a r*pist to be AG. He didn't care."
No prosecution because the FL GOP wants it to just go away.¬†
"Hey CBS, you knobs. Call it what it is. It wasn‚Äôt sex with a minor that is 110% STATUTORY RAPE BIG GUY."
Trump‚Äôs hand picked choice for AG? That Matt Gaetz?
"Gee, sex with a minor violated a law? Ya don't fuckin say. Put this piece of shit behind bars and throw away the key."
Conservative Catholics from Florida may as well publicly support pedophiles
‚Äúsex with a minor‚Äù it‚Äôs called rape
"That's a funny way to spell ""rape."""
"Trump and Elon knew this, loved this about him, then chose him for AG. Then the media had to complain about a little drug fueled pedophilic rape and they had to get rid of their best buddy."
Damn America! You really are shit at convicting and jailing pedophile politicians aren‚Äôt you? Even your president is a pedophile that‚Äôs got away with it. You done fucked up good. There‚Äôs a lot of reasons the rest of the world is laughing our arses off at you and are equally horrified and this is just one of them.
"Well, looks like Gaetz has a running chance for President now!"
The GOP is filled with them
"I know the answer but I‚Äôll say it anyways.
Why aren‚Äôt they pressing charges?"
Look the other way it‚Äôs ok he‚Äôs a white republican.
So you're telling me men don't have to pretend to be trans to continue to sexually assault and abuse women and girls??? Huh. Who wouldve thunk it
Sounds like one sex offender is going to be pardoning another sex offender fairly soon
"I assume he will be facing charges any minute now because America doesn't have two justice systems, right? Republicans? Party of law and order?

Crickets..."
"As we‚Äôve seen before, the rich protect their own. At the very least, maybe a book deal."
"This just in, crime is illegal."
"‚ÄúMatt Gaetz has earned a reputation as a relentless champion of conservative values, taking on entrenched Washington bureaucrats and exposing government overreach,‚Äù the network [OAN] said on December 10.‚Äù from a CNN article

I guess being a relentless champion of conservative values means sex with kids and doing drugs. Lol.. how hypocritical. GOP means nothing to me"
"At this stage I am half expecting the GOP to lower the age of consent, and their voting base will go along with it based on traditional values"
"""Sex with minors""

So he's like the majority of Republicans, he just have more money to hide it longer.."
"He has the premium Justice subscription, so nothing will happen as far as consequences for committing child rape and drug felonies while in government office.

The only type of insurance that works these days is Fascism, I guess."
Yeah but he wouldn't have had sex with a child but for the drugs so isn't this really all Bidens failed war on drugs' fault?
and he's not in jaillll beccaaaaaaause???
Also still shocking there were NO charges brought against him.
I mean....  he's a republican.  Does it really matter?
Trump sure knows how to pick 'em.
I will never forget that basically the entire GOP and incoming administration tried to hide this from the public and make this man AG. Truly unreal and unforgivable. Not that the cult cares.
will probably be GOP's next presidential pick
Gaetz is going to use the she didn‚Äôt tell me her age as a defense. That‚Äôs not a defense. Source: I work in the justice system.
Now I'm waiting for MTG to release more dirt like she said she would.
He stated that if his Ethics Report was revealed that he was going to reveal the dirt on the other Republicans.  LET'S SEE IT!
Watch this party lower the age of consent.
Now investigate Pizza Gaetz to see if he lied on a federal form to purchase a gun by saying he wasn‚Äôt a drug user...
Well if it isn't CAPTAIN OBVIOUS and his side kick BLATANT BOY here to deliver the news.
"Donald Trump has such a low regard for the American people that he was willing to insult the country by nominating this ""man"" as the head law enforcement officer of the United States."
So lock him up then! Enough with all the stupid do nothing headlines!
The party of Law Exception and disOrder.
"But somehow, he won't go to jail."
There is no mention of this story on Fox News website.
This is what republicans were scared of coming out...
"Sex with minor, Isn‚Äôt this statutory rape?"
Disgusting. The GOP is a party of pigs for even trying to hide this.
I know a few boobs who were obsessed with Hunter's Laptop. I haven't heard a peep out of them about Matt Gaetz.
If he'd just hung in there a little longer Elon could have had a *real* buddy.
Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
‚ÄúMatt Gaetz illegal activity was in fact illegal‚Äù eye opening headline
Silly me. I was SO sure he would be exonerated.
"I absolutely love these details coming out. I hope he goes on a vindictive spree. Share everyone's dirt. Nothing will probably happen legally but maybe _some_ people will stop voting for these corrupt piles of garbage eventually.

The crazy thing is they have illegal acts exposed but will he ever get in actual trouble for them?"
Typical Republican Christian role modem right here folks. And remember most of them voted not to release the report.
....and NOTHING will ever happen to this dick. NOTHING
He‚Äôs perfect for a Trump administration.
"So... Matt Gaetz for President, I guess?"
"Are state representatives mandatory reporters? If not, can they be? It's abhorrent that this can be kept secret at all."
What will the fake christians say now to move the goal posts on this one.
Isn't the rest a felony sans gun?  Wouldn't this make him a multiple felon?  So next in line for GOP?
Doesn't Luigi have a cousin or something?
"Investigate and charge everyone on this list, R Kelly, Diddy and the Epstein lists. I don‚Äôt care who it takes down. Maybe everyone will stop idolizing these shit bags."
Florida man does Florida things and gets elected by Florida people who see themselves in the mirror.
The regular republican newsrags have dodged posting this the way it‚Äôs supposed to be covered. This should be the top story on every news website but just shows the state of things.
And Trump and Campaign wanted this cupcake to be our next US General Attorney. WTF?!
Seems totally on brand.
"Marjorie, now it's your turn!

Do you're thing, like you promised..

Come on, we're oh so close!!!!"
Since when do the Repugs care about any of those things
These are the people our country wants running things. All the rest of us can do is sit back and hope we arent sitting in a flamable area.
"So a biased non-police like-minded political party was able to determiner all these facts, but the actual police were unable to investigate and find the same information to make an arrest - INCONCEIVABLE!!"
I am fully prepared for our society to react to the news that he statutorily raped a child with absolutely no followup.
He has a lot of influence in Florida.  Double standard state judicial system he isn‚Äôt worried
Trump will pardon him.
State laws? What about Federal laws?
So he‚Äôs still a prime fit for the party. Got it.
"Now the question is, will he actually be held accountable?"
So shoe-in for governor or senator for Florida?
Wait Matt was running the pizza parlor ALL along
Media sane-washing all of this once again with a headline like that.
"Yet Garland did jack shit, that man is beyond stupid."
"Gee I'm ***sure*** he'll face charges...

Can we get some more Luigis please?"
I love how this headline implies that if it didn't violate state laws it would have been chill.
"He didn't have sex with a minor, he assaulted a child.

Also, did we need an ethics report to tell us that those things are illegal or...?"
"There is no such thing as an adult having sex with a minor, and certainly not outside of age-difference statutes. It's called ""rape."""
I wonder if the criminal system has any intention of doing anything. I mean he‚Äôs wealthy so probably not.
"Matt Gaetz is the perfect republican.¬† I can understand why American conservatives loved him so much the reelected him even after they found out that he is a child molester.
¬†¬†¬† Gaetz will be ok though. There are lots of billionaire republicans in the world who need a man like Matt Gaetz to work as their corporate HR executives."
And he still walks freely in society...
I challenge you to find this Matt ‚Äúrapist/pedophile‚Äù Gaetz story at FoxNews.com.   Good luck with that.
"‚ÄúMatt Gaetz ethics report says his drug use and sex with a minor violated state laws‚Äù

Ya think?"
Nothing will happen to him - most likely he will get Rubios senate seat because Congress makes laws that pretty much makes them untouchable.
"You quote ""deny, defend, depose"" to an insurance agent your home gets raided the same day.  Do the police not know where gatez lives or did these *lawmakers* just forget to call 911 and report this?"
">Matt Gaetz ethics report says his drug use and sex with a minor violated state laws 

You fuckin reckon?"
I have faith the law will be applied equitably here. I am also recovering from significant head trauma.
What really blows my mind is one can habitually take mdma and remain republican.
"Mind blowing how multiple government officials can sit on this info proving this guy committed felonies and yet he‚Äôs been free the entire time. 

I have little hope for the future of this country."
"So, about that whole ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù thing? Yeah, when will that start applying to these maga republican criminals? The Republican Party was literally trying to keep this information from Americans. They‚Äôve all violated their oath of office."
Headline: President elect Donald Trump wanted a pedo as Attorney General of the United States¬†
"I don‚Äôt believe that the feds dropped the investigation. 

Another failure of the Garland DoJ."
"And you guys would never have seen the report if he was still a contender for Trump‚Äôs proposals. Just think of that - he‚Äôd be your Attorney General and this report would not be getting released, ever."
And this didn‚Äôt get him expelled from congress ü§¶
So does this guy go to jail now?
When will his run for president be announced?  There seem to be plenty of voters who don't mind this type of person.
He works for the pedo party he won‚Äôt face any consequences
"I think there's a typo. ""Sex with a minor"" is spelled: STATUTORY RAPE"
"Why does the media insist on calling it ""sex with a minor"" and not pedophilia? 
Call it by its name. He's a pedophile."
"When you‚Äôre a republican, the media calls it ‚Äúsex with a minor‚Äù. 

For everyone else it‚Äôs rape."
"Man, how unlucky is Trump?! First, comes out his good friend, who liked them even young then Trump (Jeffrey Epstein), did in fact like them as young as Trump alluded to. 

And now this. Man, he nominates an otherwise standup guy and all this bullshit falls out. Tough break.  

Who could‚Äôve seen this turn of events? Totally blindsided over a minor infraction  /s"
"Where's the trans person?  /s

What will President Musk do? /s

Will Republicans make excuses for him? YES."
"I was told Matt was bragging about sleeping with a very young girl on capital hill almost to the point that other law makers at the time was telling him to shut up about it that they were tired of hearing about it.  I have no way to collaborate this however, so use a gain of salt."
"Hey Matt run for president you will be alright,deny,deny,blame,blame,openly hate those that can‚Äôt fight back thats the ticket!"
"Not surprised with this within the GOP.
So called Christians. LoL
Biggest hypocrites."
Well by golly that looks more like a clown than a drag queen to me!
Merry Christmas gaetz you slimy fuck boy
Add another pedo to the pile that apparently people think supporting makes them look good.
Crazy! Can't wait for the state to do nothing about it.
Soooo typical republican CV. Got it.
Is anyone actually shocked?
"OK Gaetz and MTG, both of you threatened that if the report got released that you were going to name and shame all of the other sex perverts, drug users, and criminals in Congress.  Time to put up or shut up."
I don't believe in consequences anymore.
"People who knew Gaetz knew he‚Äôd been doing this since 2017. Yet, the republicans covered for him, supported him, made up excuses for him, voted for him, defended him, and his favorite rapist fraudster cult leader even tried to appoint him to be the Attorney General of the United States. Maga republicans are the lowest of the low. Traitorous scum."
Prison for the druggy pedo please
"It‚Äôs normal for politicians to abuse minors and have drug fueled parties with their lobbyist friends. People, this is perfectly fine.. In their world."
"$90k in 3 years on drugs and prostitutes.

90 fucking thousand.

Tell me again these cunts aren't getting paid too much."
"How old was she? Bc a few republicans I know said 17 doesn't really count as a minor, and some of these assholes have daughters."
"Who doesn't love blow and strippers?  Can't fault a man for that.  But he crossed the line with the sex with a minor thing.  That can't be forgiven, ever."
"Headlines need to really tell it how it is. Let‚Äôs be clear, he had sex with a CHILD."
"Merrick Garland: 'Nah, can't be bothered.'"
"Yeah, he‚Äôs a classic predator. These girls were economically vulnerable and young, and he was a sitting congressman with a ton of power. 

Also, can we investigate this relationship with his ‚Äúadopted son‚Äù Nestor? Gaetz also used his Venmo to pay for sex. This is beyond bizarre - was it all a ruse to cover up his activities? Who is Nestor?"
How did he rape a child and still not be in jail
They all read this and wanted him to be AG
This should ensure him the presidency 2028. If there even are elections.
‚ÄúDrug use‚Äù ‚Äúsex with minor‚Äù where the fuck is ‚Äújail‚Äù
Lock him up until his trial.   A teenager caught with a few joints would be in jail.
Uhh‚Ä¶so he is a pedo. Gotcha.
You mean rape of a minor. Minors can't consent.
The party of Jeff Epstein's BFF don't care
"It also violates a, you know, minor."
"Drugs and sex with a minor, you say? I'm going to make a prediction ... he will face little to no consequences for this."
"Yeah, but the president can‚Äôt pardon him for the state crimes."

"His campaign page strongly implies that he is a gun owner.

As if felonies mean anything to them at this point‚Ä¶
"Sweet, can't wait to see pictures of his junk on cspan during the hearing."
Where's that Hunter Biden energy?
Felonies aren't what they used to be. I know a guy who had 34 of them and wasn't even invited to sentencing day.
party of family values
I'm starting to think the GOP considers committing crimes to be a job qualification for making or enforcing laws since you'd be getting direct experience with the legal/justice system.
Doubt they even asked
"Not to pick nits, but I don't believe ""that's a felony"" is true. I believe the law is that it would be illegal for him to purchase a gun at the point (as a drug user), but if he already owned a gun, then I don't believe he violated any laws."
Not if they never charge you.
"I'm waiting on Marge to get her ass in gear and make good on her threat to expose a bunch of other people in congress if the GOP released the Gaetz report.

If she does we might find out who planted those pipe bombs on January 6th too. Someone said that if Marge made good on her threat they'd encourage a deeper look into that one. 

What a Merry Christmas it would be if we saw the implosion of the GOP."
How blissfull it must be to be able to chalk up any negative thing as fake news.
Because that's going to have any effect what-so-ever.
"I was about to say I guess the age of consent was 16 (Georgia) like it is I some parts of the country.


But I just looked up Florida's age of consent, and it's 18.


I guess being a wealthy republican had benefits.¬†"
"In the normal world we call it ""sanewashing"".  They did it a LOT with trump"
party of family values
I agree the media goes way too soft in language but I would imagine they probably can‚Äôt say the words ‚Äústatutory rape‚Äù in an instance where he (unfortunately) hasn‚Äôt been charged with that as a crime.

You're literally doing exactly what you're trying to call out but actually and worse lol.
Because it does make it sound better. Saying ‚Äúhe raped a child‚Äù makes it sound like he pinned a child down and forcefully had sex with them.
"Well, we don‚Äôt want to offend any Republicans. /s"
"Always a game of word jumble when describing the crimes of the rich and powerful. They work for the rich and powerful, gloss over their crimes."
"He‚Äôs confused, he will say he didn‚Äôt know she was"

Someone wane garland and try to get him to give a fuck.
At least he‚Äôs representing their base.
"Remember,  Trump knew what was in this report and still wanted him for AG."
"That was Hunter Biden's problem. He didn't rape any kids. If he had, Republicans would have voted the Bidens by the masses."
"Republican lawmakers: Yeah, and?"
Well they‚Äôve voted one president twice
*Youth Pastor heavy breathing intensifies*
Giving Drump a run for his money.
Nothing? He will get a cushy position in his daddy's firm and be set for life while getting periodic gigs to run his mouth on various influential media outlets.
"This is WHY Trump wanted him as AG. He wanted someone AG who he could threaten with exposure if they didn't do as he said.

Trump, like the Mob, like Russia, loves compromised people."
Hey garland has a plan to think about doing something by 2040.
"He's out of politics for the moment, so that's something."
"Well of course he won't. After all, he didn't harm a CEO."
Not in the present but history will not be kind to this man
Not even for lying on a gun questionnaire.  Because you know he owns a gun.
"Gotta convince a state prosecutor to pursue state criminal charges, which means convincing Florida's government to do something mean to a Republican."
"They didn‚Äôt have strong enough evidence that he broke federal law. He could hopefully face state charges. From the NYT, and a quote from the report:

>However, the committee said it did not find conclusive evidence that Mr. Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws.

>‚ÄúAlthough Representative Gaetz did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex, the committee did not find evidence that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion,‚Äù the panel wrote."
"He also crossed state lines with a minor. 

Can someone wake up garland?"
It‚Äôs not a justice system. It‚Äôs a legal system.  There is no justice.
"I am a Democrat who despises Matt Gaetz, but I wish we could avoid spreading lazy disinformation that attacks the government officials who *do* good work.

1. This is not ""the federal government."" It's the Republican-led House Ethics Committee.

2. They specifically found substantial evidence that he violated state laws, but not federal ones.  I think that's ""calling for"" state prosecution.

3. How often is someone sentenced to life imprisonment for simple possession of weed?

Casual nihilist disinformation isn't any better because it *feels* righteous.  All it does is enable extremists like Matt Gaetz, who say, ""See?  Everything is awful, so why not elect an awful person like me?"""
"I hate Gaetz more than a lot of people I am sure, but, this report was just released today. It was rumored and talked about sure, but to say they voted him in ""knowing all of this"" just seems a little false."
The House began investigating him well before he was tapped by Trump to run the DOJ. That's why Trump's pick was so shocking. People in Congress already knew he raped a minor.
Only the best people!
Trump's transition team is currently literally using a private email service system. Just like hillarys.
"Gone but non forgotten. Santos was given a reprieve because of his massive contribution to society, having invented the hot dog bun, forever altering the sport of watching baseball games."
"To add to this:

The fundamental difference between conservatives and progressives is in regard to hierarchies. Specifically:

- Conservatives believe that hierarchies are natural. They *must not* be changed - even if they are unjust.

- Progressives believe that hierarchies are artificial. If they are unjust, they *must* be changed.

Why does this matter? Simply put:

If social hierarchies are artificial, then it follows that the values of a social group should be enforced equally for all members - for the status of each member is equally artificial, and therefore irrelevant.

This is why progressives are quick to eject even high-ranking members that violate group values.

If social hierarchies are natural, however, then it follows that members should receive differing treatment based on status.

This is why conservatives will handwave the crimes of high-ranking members, while inventing crimes with which to persecute the low-ranking members.

Literally: conservatives do not believe that behavior determines whether a person is moral. Rather, the person‚Äôs status *determines whether their actions are moral.*

Donald Trump has many failings; but his assessment - that he cannot do wrong in the eyes of his supporters - is wholly accurate."
As soon as you hear ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù you know you are talking to a dummy.
"The committee only found violations of state laws, which cannot be pursued by federal prosecutors."
"I also want to know why so many congresspeople blocked the release of this report for so long, knowing full well what he did."
"there's an R beside his name, that's basically immunity there."

"‚ÄúThe Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,‚Äù former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper‚Äôs writer Dan Baum for the April cover story published Tuesday.

‚ÄúYou understand what I‚Äôm saying? We knew we couldn‚Äôt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,‚Äù Ehrlichman said. ‚ÄúWe could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

Garland had zero interest in holding Republicans accountable. Biden fucked up so bad with that pick.
It cracks me up the people that think that their politicians would never lol
"Why would Trump care?  The sad part is that everyone knew and still voted for him, or sat home and didn't vote for anyone else."
"They already do, and have for decades."

"How about a moving window?  Going by the youngest person in the couple:  15 year old a 1 year window.  16 year old 18 months.  17 year old 2 years.  This is by actual dates of birth, not year ages.  But never anyone over 20 with a teen under 18."
It cracks me up the people that think these people are innocent

Trump wanted him to be AG. The GOP cowards buried it until they felt like they had a politically opportune time to throw him under the bus.

True but this was like literally the only thing they could pin on Hunter Biden.
"I don't see why pedophile child sex trafficker Matt Gaetz would care about something as trivial as the law. As a republican trump cock-sucker he's free of such petty restrictions.

Matt Gaetz is free to rape as many children as he wants to rape, and Matt Gaetz the child sex trafficker really REALLY likes to rape children, on account of Matt Gaetz being a rapist who rapes children.

That's how the country works. If you don't like that, it's your fault for not being rich enough to matter."

"I graduated high school in 1989. I didn't realize until decades later that: a) age of consent was 18; and, b) there were no Romeo and Juliet laws at the time. 

Lots of lawbreakers in high school."
"In (I believe) every place that it‚Äôs 16, there are exceptions in place. For instance in PA, it is 6 I believe up to a 4 year age difference until you‚Äôre 18. A 32 year old man cannot have sex with a 16 year old even thought the age of consent is 16

Even if Georgia was 16, he would still be guilty of statutory rape"
I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs just the wealthy part and not the political party. I do get where you are coming from though since the republicans seem to not care about flaunting it.
This is how news sources title things. They quote the term statutory rape near the start off article.
It normalizes calling it sex which lets more people think it‚Äôs consensual. Calling it rape solidifies it as nonconsensual.
Absolutely insane world we live in.
How does this not hurt Trump? It would hurt anyone else. But Trump supporting pedophiles is just sanewashed away

The Mann Act doesn‚Äôt require they be under 18
"Garland is a little bitch, he won‚Äôt do anything"
"The report says the girls that crossed state lines with him were at least 18, prostitutes, but not coerced. We need to be real here instead of throwing out misinformation like the other side. The underage girl he paid for sex was at a party in FL. He also paid her for sex again some point after she turned 18."
"Nice job, 50+ upvotes for literally lying about the content of the report.

""*although Representative Gaetz did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex, the Committee did not find evidence that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel*""

EDIT: downvotes for quoting the report. Apparently it needs to be clarified that this is not a defense of Gaetz, it's a defense of reading."
Oh I would go farther.  I think the entire political culture in the USA is broken beyond repair.
It was confirmed before the congressional report was concluded. He‚Äôs was under criminal investigation for quite a while and was lucky why they didn‚Äôt want to bring charges.

"He didn't invent the hot dog bun, he perfected it. He invented the bicycle and the question mark, though."
He also managed to kill the United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.  He's a true folk hero.
"As an aside: what does this mean from a practical perspective?

Convincing conservatives to discontinue support for high-ranking members - based on the crimes of the latter - is a fool‚Äôs game.

Instead, the goal should be to reduce the perceived status of the high-ranking members.

Case in point: Matt Gaetz is quickly becoming a pariah among conservatives; not because of the crimes he‚Äôs committed, but because their publication signals that he‚Äôs (long since!) lost favor with conservative leadership.

Similarly: the fastest way to shut down Trump was to prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law. Many of his supporters would cry foul; but even they could not ignore his loss of status once they saw their beloved leader wearing an orange jumpsuit.

(Obligatory: fuck Merrick Garland.)

And to be clear: none of this is to say that Trump et al. should be persecuted; rather, that they should be held to the same standard progressives hold themselves, which also serves to reduce their status in the eyes of conservatives."
"It isn't that they're dumb.

It's that they've grown so cynical that their cynicism is itself a shield against reality. Everyone is evil, every organization is corrupt, nobody is different, nobody is better.

And when everyone is evil, you get to pick your poison don't you? Because at the end of the day, it's a distinction without a difference. They're all bad.

""Both Sides"" is just a lazy man's excuse for not doing the work to figure out who *really* is perpetuating all the problems. ""There's no fixing it, they're all corrupt"" is an easy copout, freeing them of the responsibility to put in the real effort to understand what's actually happening.

It's how Nancy Pelosi can have her husband assaulted and still be the devil for trading stocks. And how Biden can be a mob boss even when Hunter's biggest crimes -owning a gun and not paying his taxes- are things that Republicans normally cheer for."
"Yeah they‚Äôre actually quite different. One side has truly reprehensible values and is steadfast in achieving them through any crooked means necessary, while the other has basic common sense policies to move the needle forward for society but at the highest leadership levels are completely unserious in making them happen."
"Findings can still be referred to relevant authorities. Findings can still be made public. 

Somewhere along the way someone saw all this, knew it was illegal, but not conveniently so, and mothballed it. With the exception of issues of national security, nothing that goes on in Congress should be capable of being hidden, especially ethics reports."

"It's not just rich people. The white/black divide is huge, far more than can be explained by wealth. 

I used to work for my state's court system, and a city court requested a report on minor drug charges for the prior year, with adjudications. This was fairly standard. But on this report they specifically asked us to add a column for race.

In that city, over the prior year, about 1/3 of minor drug charges for white people ended in convictions that were not dismissed. So 2/3 of the time white defendants walked away with nothing on their record.

Same city, same time period, and same charges - black defendants had their charges dismissed about 1/10 of the time. So 90% of the time they walked away with a record.

There's just no way to explain that away as a wealth difference. 

We have multiple concurrent problems with our legal system. Yes rich people don't live by the same laws as us pleebs, but as a white person I also don't live by the same laws as black people."
I‚Äôve read your comment history and no one should be listening to you on the topics of racism and sexism. Also your comment contradicts your entire assumed point.
"The US voted for a renowned conman, with multiple bankruptcies, felonies, and is banned from even running charities in the state he is from. He‚Äôs got folks around him that have said they‚Äôd like to try and get him to run for a third term, and he‚Äôs already tried to get other countries to dig up dirt on his opponents because he legally couldn‚Äôt in the US.

"I mean sure, but the president‚Äôs pardon power is specifically defined in the constitution to be applicable to offenses against ‚ÄúThe ***United*** States‚Äù

It was an upset in the sense that people didn‚Äôt expect them to actually win but it wasn‚Äôt massive."
They are beyond that completely anyway.  The entire party and their constituency has established that their politicians can get away with anything as long as their selfishness is placated.

In Florida,  for relevance's sake,  the age is 18, but if you're under 23 sex with a 16 or 17 year old isn't illegal."
"Unfortunately, it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent_in_the_United_States"
"Pretty sure age of consent is 16 in many places. The UK and much of Europe it is.   

I think the challenge is balancing the fact that 16 year olds are going to fuck no matter what, and making them criminals is a waste of everyone's time, and preventing 40 year old men from preying on 16 year old girls. 

Many places put in Romeo and Juliet laws to handle age *gaps* instead of absolute ages."

The sheer number of veterans I know who stan him despite literally everything about him still staggers me.
"I've been saying this to no one in particular for years now. There could be leaked footage of trump raping a 9 year old Ivanka, and his supporters wouldn't even budge their support.

Their cynicism is a shield to allow them to do what they want. They use it to ignore the evil being perpetrated in their name, claiming that no other choice would be any better.

It isn't stupidity, it's a deliberate blind spot, an unwillingness to actually engage.

Think back to when you were a kid. I'm sure you can remember a time when you were wronged and stood up for yourself, only to have *everyone* get punished, including you. Do you remember how unfair that felt?

These people are those parents, unwilling or unable to untangle the mass of wrongs laid out before them. They have no *discernment*, no mechanism for gauging things with any granularity. They just want to punish everyone equally because all they can tell is ""they're all bad""."

"Years ago, I was shocked to learn that the age of consent was 14 in Canada. It's since been changed to 16, but not that long ago. 

Either way, I'm about matt Gaetz's age and the thought of going anywhere near those ages is repulsive."
"14 in Italy if you don‚Äôt have influence on the minor like being a teacher, a legal guardian, a parent or something similar; if you do, the age goes up to a mere 16.

There‚Äôs no maximum difference either, so a 90 years old could have sex with a 14 years old on their birthday.

Disgusting even to think about, but sadly legal."
"Drops the age to 14 in some states, at least it used to the mid 2010s.

"Romeo and Juliet laws apply if one party is under the age of consent (e.g. If the age of consent is 16, a 17 yo and a 15 yo are fine because they're within 4 years of each other). The age of consent is the age you are old enough to consent. If you can consent all is legal."
"I can't remember the reference, but ""half your age plus 7"" seems like a good rule of thumb."
"I remember not too long ago there was a headline about a state bumping it up to 16

"You educate the victims.

The people who do it deliberately aren't *everyone*. You break the stranglehold that ultra-conservative media has, tear down the echo chambers (both right AND left) and encourage real discourse devoid of vitrolic hyperbole (Democrats are not demons. Republicans are not terrorists.)

You reinstitute the rules of journalism, this time as LAW. You undo the precedent that allows news media to spread deliberate falsehood. Rehabilitate reporting as a profession with enforceable professional standards.

Then we reinstate the power of the Ethics Committee in Congress. We create an elections board that has majority non-partisan members with representatives of both parties in the minority.

We uncap the house, allowing it to grow to be more representative of the actual population. The number of representatives right now is ridiculously small. There will need to be a cap, but with modern technology theres no reason that cap can't be a thousand or more. The house is struggling to do the people's business partially because there's just too much business to do.

While we're at it, we might consider slightly expanding the Senate so that they can support more committees and other things. The idea that Congress lacks enough bodies to manage all of the people's business is atrociously stupid and should be rectified. Fuck tradition.

Beyond that, we get into larger issues: Supreme Court Reform, the Electoral College, the Equal Rights Amendment (seriously, ratify it already), overturning Citizens United, and reinstating all the provisions of the Voting Rights Act. Then we start pushing for a constitutional amendment that requires mathematically drawn districts.

There's more. So much more. But even this list would be huge."

">Cadbury's US owners, Mondelez International, said it was disappointed to have been stripped of its warrant.

>Warrant holders are allowed to use the coat of arms of the royal they are associated with on packaging, as part of advertising or on stationery.

Mondelez...eh."
Looks like it was stripped because they still work with Russia.
"Fully deserved, the entire brand went down the toilet after the Kraft takeover in 2010."
"For Americans this is like Oprah's Favorite Things list, but for the British Royalty."
"The Royal Warrant is a seal of approval that is subject to non-renewal at the behest of the person awarding it. Currently, that would be the King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales. 

It is not likely that the Warrants will be granted to companies whose practices do not align with the values of the grantor. Chocolate companies as a whole are not known for being socially or environmentally responsible, so the decision not to renew the warrant ( or, more accurately, not to grant one to Cadbury) would be one of the few powers the King can exercise as himself, as opposed to ‚Äúthe Sovereign‚Äù - nobody‚Äôs holding a gun to his head on decisions like this."
The exquisite little Royal Warrant bass relief sculptures you occasionally come across above shop signs on London streets are really cool to see.
Good. Cadbury has been going down hill for years and has recently knowingly fucked up a sewage plant down in Tassie.
"Possibly because since the original Cadbury's sold the business, it has lost a lot of respect in the UK. Promising to keep factories open, then reneging. Changing recipes to make cheaper, sweeter chocolate. 

There is definitely a feeling that Cadbury's isn't what it was, even if the standard of chocolate was never all that great."
Tony's chocolonely should have it. I know they lost their rainforest alliance badge but the argument they gave seems pretty fair enough to me
Wise decision by Royal Family .
"I don't know about England but here the stuff is full of crap. I used to love the Cadbury eggs, but no good ingredients now for years."
Well if they didn't keep en-shittening their chocolate maybe they could've kept it
Yanks ruined it. Tastes like shit compared to how it used to. Cheap crap now.
"Cadbury was great until it became owned by Americans, now it tastes like American chocolate. I have travelled around the world to over 30+ countries and I‚Äôve eaten chocolate in every one of them. 

American mass market chocolate is garbage. Full of corn syrup, hydrogenated vegetable oils and other processed ingredients. It‚Äôs not even remotely good chocolate. It‚Äôs a shame that the Cadbury brand has been diluted in this way. 

*From Wikipedia:*

*In 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl√©, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.*

*Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù if the product contains any of these ingredients.*

*In the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù.*

*In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ‚ÄúCacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.‚Äù*

With American corporate giants, it‚Äôs all about profit."
"I have a visceral reaction just remembering the trauma of the texture, filmy residue coated all over my mouth, and the unholy sensation in gulping it all down..

Horrible, truly detestable, and inhumane"
"I ate some nestle ""chocolate"" today. I almost hurts the back of my throat. The slow conditioning by corporations worldwide that this palm oil and palm sugar mix with who knows what else in is normal is actually horrific.

We are left with very few options between chocolate that isn't chocolate from retailers or overpriced boutique chocolate from dedicated shops.

I just want a medium sized block of glass and a half full cream milk with old school cane sugar with a proper amount of cocoa in it. Nothing fancy. Just real."
"Gee I wonder why. Maybe because they made it cheap. It doesn‚Äôt taste like Cadbury anymore. Maybe make it how it was supposed to be made with good ingredients. Damn Americans fucking shit up. And yes I‚Äôm Americans. Used to love Cadbury chocolate. It‚Äôs now just, at best, mediocre."
"Good, but also FUCK NESTL√â! 

r/FuckNestle"
"There‚Äôs a serious Mandela effect around Cadbury in the UK, that it used to be good chocolate until it was taken over.

I think this is rooted in 2 things:

Until about the early 2000s, the UK had very little premium chocolate on the market. Even brands like Lindt and Thorntons were considered top tier. Now the average standard has shot up a lot and Cadbury is revealed as bottom of the pile.

A lot of people liked Cadbury as children, and it has always been largely marketed to children. Children will basically eat anything sweet and are rarely buying any premium chocolate. Lots of adults mistake their fond memories of stuffing their face with cheap chocolate when they were 8 with it being good quality chocolate, and are now comparing it to more premium chocolate that‚Äôs on the market now.

I remember having this conversation with my mum back in the ‚Äò90s, and she would insist that Cadbury used to be good quality chocolate back in the ‚Äò60s and now it‚Äôs sweet crap.

IMO they make poor quality cheap chocolate aimed at children and always have done"
"Delicious as a kid, but now it tastes like regular chocolate"
TLDR: the royal warrant was rescinded bc Mondelez is still operating in Russia.
"So they should. Since they were taken over by Kraft (now Mondelez International) the products have got worst, they have no honoured their commitment not to move UK brand manufacture abroad, and they have not maintained Cadbury's standards of worker welfare or philanthropy.

I am not a royalist, but this is the sort of thing the King is meant care about, and this move backs that up."
Cadbury chocolate is poor.
"As a non-Brit, I expected a royal warrant to consist of a poster of the CEO and the words ‚ÄûWanted by the King. Dead or Alive.‚Äú"
">US food company Kraft took over the brand in a controversial takeover in 2010, with Cadbury going on to become part of its Mondelez division in 2012.

I wouldn't expect a now-US company to continue to have this honor."
"The cr√®me eggs in the 80s were great, but thereafter sucked badly."
Oh no! Consequences from our actions...¬†
"Wish the Norwegian King does the same. Freia (owned by Mondelez) sell their most expensive confectionery using the name of the former King Haakon. I‚Äôm pretty sure the King can do something about it if he wants.

Freia was originally a Norwegian company and the chocolate was introduced in 1905 when Norway became  independent from Sweden. That had ¬´won¬ª Norway from Denmark. I think having the former Kings name on a Mondelez product supporting an occupation is a huge insult. The current King was born in 1937 and had to be evacuated from the Nazis. So if anyone he should make the the right call and have this product stopped unless Mondelez withdraws."
Can we do a swap? Cadbury for Budweiser.
I'm going through the house and binning anything from any of these shite companies.
Good it's gone to shit
"I bought a box of bars as Christmas gifts but I tasted one and they‚Äôre awful! They‚Äôre caramel bars and the ‚Äúcaramel‚Äù isn‚Äôt but whatever it is, it‚Äôs really bad. The chocolate tasted like plastic! I‚Äôm not surprised by this move, and I miss what used to be my favorite candy."

"Mondelez lost the right to the Swedish version of this a while ago as well, because of the same thing."
"Frankly the government were cowards for allowing the Kraft/Mondelez acquisition in the first place. 

Cadbury weren't in any financial difficulty, they didn't need rescuing; it was a centuries-old much-loved British institution that got acquired by a foreign company in a hostile takeover out of greed."
"Mondelez nuts, gottem"
"Ritter Sport as well, I stopped buying them because they still work in russia."
Eww.  Well I guess no more cream eggs for me üò¢
There are still companies on the list that work with/in Russia so maybe part of the reason but not the sole motivation.
"No, that‚Äôs not why. It‚Äôs because Kraft bought the company in a forced buyout and then proceeded to degrade the product. They changed the recipe and reduced the size of most of the classic Cadbury selection ~ to the point where the candy was not worthy of a royal warrant, and it was dropped."
What? No? No more then.
"You mean its not because they make some of the worst ""quails chocolate"" on thr market??"
"I‚Äôd rather Russia spend their money on chocolate than missiles.  

Change that - if they‚Äôre going to buy Cadbury, let it be the US shit Hershey makes under the Cadbury name. The stuff is a travesty. I‚Äôve been importing Cadbury from the UK for years since Hershey bought the rights."
Still ok for brands to work with Israel???? I‚Äôm confused
"Everyone secretly still works with Russia, especially Germany as they own a third of the Russian gas infrastructure.

Puts the war related energy crisis into perspective."
"Here in the US it‚Äôs manufactured by Hershey. For a few years after acquisition it was still a quality product but the past two years the Cadbury brand has gone downhill. The chocolate is no longer creamy, just a chalky mess."
It ain't want it used to be :(
"For some sectors I'm sure it's an amazing thing to hold (bespoke tailors, luxury vehicle dealers, wine merchants etc) but I wonder what value general companies gain from it? Obviously any endorsement is great but I can't imagine Heinz, for example, caring much either way? 

Is it even on their packaging?"
"It sounds very classy though, I love it from the US"
I mean. Cadburys sucks though
"So who the fuck cares then, right?"
Thank you for the translation.
It says in the article that it was removed because the company is still operating in Russia.
I know you're being slammed but I feel the Russian point was just the final nail in the coffin...¬†
It helps to read the article instead of just making up reasons to justify the headline
It was really good 50 years ago. I wouldn't eat it now.
Used to be good chocolate imo. It's average chocolate now. But compared to American chocolate its god tier lol.
"Not even ‚Äòchocolate‚Äô anymore, but downgraded to *candy* as there‚Äôs not enough cocoa."
"Our business model is quality down, price up, until there's public backlash. Then rename it and try again."
"Yes, it's our fault an international company strip mined a brand. Never happened before."
"I remember the taste of British chocolate from when I was a child. It was so different from what I'm used to, and also delicious. I hadn't known that chocolate could actually taste so good until I had one of those. I stuffed myself with chocolate during that trip. When I tried it again years later as an adult it tasted just like our stuff and I thought perhaps I had imagined how good it was, now I have my answer. I guess it really was that good before America took over."
I foolishly thought US Cadbury and UK Cadbury were different. Like US kit Kat isn't Nestle. That kind of thing.
I used to love getting their chocolate orange.
If they didn't want it that way the limeys shouldn't have sold it ü§∑
That's what she said
It's as bad as Hersey's now.  Just awful
"In New Zealand Cadbury used to be the preferred chocolate over the NZ brand Whittakers. 

Then it must have been around 2010 from memory (and date lines up with the Kraft takeover), Cadbury added palm oil to their recipe. There was a HUGE country wide backlash and everyone started buying Whittakers in protest (which at the time was more expensive so bought less often).

Then we all realised Whittakers is far superior to Cadbury anyway. Cadbury removed the palm oil due to the backlash but the damage had been done. 

Now every year Cadbury remains the cheaper chocolate but they keep making their block sizes smaller and smaller. 

Whittakers goes up in price every few years but the block size stays the same. Whittakers absolutely won the war on chocolate in NZ. Cadbury had to close the NZ factory, and now our Cadbury chocolate is all made in Australia. 

Whittakers is top tier chocolate and it‚Äôs delicious. Cadbury has a weird taste and a texture like plastic."
"A few decades ago I‚Äôd have put U.K. chocolate above most generic American chocolate (particularly those containing butyric acid) but below most continental European chocolate. As a kid I remember on holiday that generic chocolate in France, Germany and Norway being noticeably nicer. 

You make a good point about nostalgia but I genuinely do think Cadburys has become a bit worse tasting since the Kraft takeover - it‚Äôs gone from half decent albeit nothing special to mostly not worth the effort."
"Cadbury was good when I was quite a bit younger, but when Mondelez started focusing on profits, it went downhill fast."
"Heinz has the honor. It's not because they are an American company now, it's because Mondelez refuses to pull out of Russia."
Samsung have just been awarded one. It's not about where the company's from.

"Chocolate, not candy. This is the UK dear."
"It's an individual thing.  For example, auto glym used to have warrants from both the Queen and Prince Charles."
"Impossible to know, not like it has an article associated with it you could read and learn about."
Many many butlers will be sent to find you.
Legal action by the Royal Family presumably
Because it's not just a claim but involves putting the royal coat of arms on the product. That's the signal of the Royal Warrant. The Royal Family can own the image of their royal coat of arms in other countries. You don't have to be American to own the rights to something in America.

You just made me check my Colman‚Äôs English Mustard.  The warrant is on the front label above the brand and product.  It would seem they are quite proud of it!
"It implies quality. Presumably, the monarchy has access to all sorts of luxurious products, so to be told ""the king likes this chocolate"" implies that he likes it *compared to its competitors*. Whether that's accurate is unimportant."

It certainly matters to Hyacinth Bucket.
"It is on the packaging, yes!"

"It‚Äôs more honourable in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù companies having it, especially in Foods. It means that your product is so good that it is used by royals. It is easy for bespoke tailors and car brands to get it because their access is nearly limitless.

Even Samsung print the warrant on the boxes for their TVs sold in the UK.
"Yes, if you have a royal warrant you are allowed to print the royal insignia on your packaging."

I would be shocked if it isn't on the packaging. This is a big source of price for UK brands.
"Fun fact, I was using a stage broom at work and noticed it had a royal warrant on the brush head."
"Its like a ""quality guaranteed"" stamp. The warrant means that it's something regularly used by the Royal Family, which means it must be a good quality product. At least, that's the reasoning."

US Cadburys chocolate is supposed to be very inferior to the UK version. Never tried the UK version to confirm that though.
They are no Hershey's but they aren't that bad.
Bad company - delicious chocolate.
Not to mention Cadbury chocolate is utterly atrocious these days. Literal garbage.
You assume people around here read more than the headline.
"It doesn't say that, it only suggests it by mentioning pressure from a campaign group.¬†


Could easily be for a whole combination of reasons."
"That may be a small part of the reason, but it's likely just that he long ago disliked the brand due to the changes made by the new owners, and made it a personal decision to stop buying it within the household. For British people it's not the least bit surprising."
"With Fry's, Duncans etc., they had decent competition in the same market-place to keep them on track."
It doesn't take much to be better than Hershey's. The US has smaller chocolate makers that are better than the new Cadbury stuff.
"I will admit to being partial to Dairy Milk. US chocolate is strange to me, something to do with boiling the milk during manufacturing giving it a slightly butyric acid flavour. (Same thing giving Parmesan its distinctive odour (or more extremely, vomit)"
It is significantly below average. There are many quality chocolate makers these days. Cadbury is bottom-tier at this point.
"> But compared to American chocolate its god tier lol

That's an awfully low bar to pass over."
"Or worse yet, buy a different company with a good product and then run their product into the ground and repeat the cycle all over again."
"Australian here. I‚Äôve noticed whittakers taking up more shelf space in supermarkets here which means it‚Äôs selling well. They still have 250g blocks while cadburys went from 250g to 220 to 200 and just recently 180

Buying 250g of chocolate of either brand is comparable price, whittakers comes in bigger blocks and tastes so much better

They haven‚Äôt really done any advertising here but the shelf space allocation says that I‚Äôm not the only person who has noticed the difference"

The family sold Cadbury Chocolate to Mondelez and the quality plummeted. I think they use more sugar and less cocoa solids. It's still 'ok' but nothing like it used to be. James Cadbury made his own chocolate business called 'Lovecocoa'. My sister got me some a couple years ago for Xmas - it's really good but not cheap.
">To be fair Cadbury has been kind of garbage for a while.

Cadbury chocolate was great when they were still using the foil packing.  When they changed to the all plastic wrapper they also changed what they put into the chocolate which ruined the texture.  A few years back they changed something else which made the chocolate even worse.  It is sad, a block of Cadbury Top Deck was my go-to sweet cheat for most of my early adulthood but now their white chocolate is just terrible and the milk chocolate isn't much better."
Yea when it sold it became tasteless trash they destroyed a tradition.
"Still better than Hershey‚Äôs, but that‚Äôs a very low bar"
And there is a night and day difference between proper Cadbury and the Cadbury that is sold in the US.
"Except there's Crack in those things or something. I get a box, I pull one out to eat it, next thing I know I'm surrounded by 50 boxes and 300 wrappers with no memory of how I got here."

Colmans mustard is one of those products that I will accept no substitute for. It's just unbeatable.
"The loss of a warrant also implies a decrease in whatever attributes made the product great in the first place. Then again, the royal is Chuckles."

I don‚Äôt think Americans quite get it but there should be pride in even making cheap foods. Gaining that royaL endorsement means that your product is so good that it is used by royals.
"Though these days, and considering who the royals are, it's more liable to culminate in making your fingers look like fat sausages."
It‚Äôs going down hill in fits and starts. They keep messing with recipes. Claiming it is to improve the flavour but it‚Äôs about using cheaper ingredients. Used to be a firm favourite in our household but now we almost never buy Cadbury.
"It used to be delicious, and then Kraft/Mondelez bought it and changed all the recipes."
Right? It used to be so good. I never bother with it now. I‚Äôll go for Tony‚Äôs Chocolonely or something similar.
Honestly I‚Äôve learned not to assume they‚Äôve even read the headline.
... They didn't assume. They know they didn't
Yeah no doubt it does. Can you walk into a supermarket and buy good chocolate in USA? Or is it all that chocolate flavoured shite herseys sell?
I tried herseys kisses once. Absolutely vile. I would rather eat nothing than that stuff not even kidding.
Acquire! Destroy! Repeat!
"I am ready for nz to take over the world via Whittakers hahaha 

I love that it‚Äôs hopefully drowning out Cadbury in other countries too!

The Cadbury block size shrink is insane"
"Yeah, I remember as a kid never buying Whittakers and only Cadbury because the block size was the same but it was cheaper (and probably advertised more). I never liked peanuts so never had the slabs, but I don‚Äôt remember ever buying Whittakers as a kid (but remember seeing it in the supermarkets)"

"Yes. And by following this free market, we saw our government sell off our public sector.

Now utilities and travel and previous institutions that provide services are no longer burdened with the issues of regulation, clean water, improvement of infrastructure.

Now they can focus on the matter at hand, removing as much money from your pocket as possible.

This is less criminal when we‚Äôre talking chocolate but the sentiment is all the same."
"Also if you read up on what happened, they rejected Kraft's proposal for M&A, and ended up being forced into it under threat of hostile takeover. So it's not even a case of ""the owners wanted to sell their business""."
"The UK and Europe are not ‚Äúsocial market‚Äù countries. That‚Äôs more like China. There‚Äôs actually very minimal difference between US, Canada, UK, and EU when it comes to competition and antitrust laws."

And palm oil instead of cocoa butter.
Mondelez also bought Oreo and fucked them over too. Fucking hate that company.
"Did the ol' *more palm oil, less chocolate* maneuver to cut corners no doubt. It was inevitable as soon as they got bought out by Kraft in 2010. *""Shittier product, higher quarterly profit""* is practically the motto of every major American corporation these days."
"Hah i knew something was off. When i came to UK 18 years ago , Cadbury was the first local choc i tried and i was blown away by this new (to me) thing. Then i tried it again recently and was asking myself how could i have liked that ??"
"Even ""proper Cadbury"" is absolute rubbish now. It is brown and sweet, but that's about as close as it gets to being chocolate."
"I'm going to take some flak for this, but I *love* American Cadbury milk chocolate. I honestly like it more than the old UK Cadbury bars."
Oh I see you go through the same phenomenon as I do then.
You should probably avoid the peanut butter cr√®me sandwiches then - those are even more dangerous (and delicious!).

That tracks with US food (and beauty product) trends. Things are constantly reformulated and containers are getting smaller. Paying more money for less of something that‚Äôs no longer even what you want anymore. It‚Äôs exhausting
Yes. Usually lots of organic / fair trade etc options too.
Tony‚Äôs Chocoloney is a good quality brand that‚Äôs available in lots of stores.
"Yes, why on earth would Hershey and other bottom tier chocolate be all that‚Äôs available in US supermarkets? Do Tesco and Waitrose only sell Cadbury or might they have a bit more choice than that?"
"It's like Australia, it's lollies not candy."
The government can block private sales of this kind if they wanted to. Essentially the argument would be the government could‚Äôve done more to ensure it was sold to someone who was more invested in Britain and maintaining a British institution.

"The EU is quite literally one...

"Ironically palm oil was originally a cheap substitute but now more expensive, but the British got used to the taste. I think it's the sugar content they use which ruined it.

"Yup yup yup, sell everything that isn't bolted to the ground.

"I don‚Äôt  like milk chocolate, so I tend to think both Cadbury and Hershey (and throw Nestle in there too) taste like bad chocolate. So I‚Äôll take your word for it that Hershey is worse, especially since that seems to be the general consensus. 

US supermarkets will generally have Hershey, Cadbury, Mars, Nestle, Toblerone, Lindt or Lindor, Ritter Sport, and several small brands that make bars of extremely dark fair trade chocolate, often with batch numbers and origin of the cacao printed on the labels. More upscale supermarkets will have nicer brands and products in general, and that‚Äôs going to be reflected in their chocolate selection."

"For those who can't read: ""...commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates, changing their punishment to life imprisonment without parole.""

They aren't free."
"Ironically for the 3 terrorists, the alternative, life at ADX specifically, is probably worse than death."
"Texas, 'that's fine, we'll just kill 37 people by January'."
"Would be interesting to see statistics, how long have these people been on the death row. In Dzhokhar Tsarnaev‚Äòs case, it‚Äôs been ongoing for 11 years (and will continue since he was excluded from Biden‚Äôs commutation). Just earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered another investigation into original sentencing and said a new penalty-phase trial may be necessary.

That‚Äôs the problem with the death penalty, it became so incredibly difficult (and expensive) to execute someone, this no longer makes any practical sense."
That is interesting that Biden effectively supports the death penalty in extremely rare cases (terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder). I don't think he ever specifically said that before.
"Damn, 37 out of 40!

""Your sentence is commuted, your sentence is commuted, your sentence is commuted... but fuck *you* three, y'all are *still* gonna fry!"""
"For those saying this leaves a muddled message since some death sentences are still remaining I think it's relatively clear that terror is the line that shouldn't be crossed (now how that is defined might be squishy).  Also, with saying how capital punishment was dealt with in the past, it was unfair.  But the three who remain are relatively recent and weren't in that ""tough on crime"" era mindset.

I don't agree with death penalty ever but think Biden took a coherent approach here."
">The clemency action applies to all federal death row inmates except three convicted of terrorism or hate-motivated mass murder: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted of carrying out the 2013 Boston marathon bombing attack; Dylann Roof, who shot dead nine Black church members in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; and Robert Bowers, who stormed a synagogue in the heart of Pittsburgh‚Äôs Jewish community and killed 11 worshippers in 2018.

For Biden, the bar is terrorism. Not looking good for Luigi. The next administration will use this rhetoric to protect the elite class. They'll say ""we disagree, but even the Dems think terrorists deserve no quarter""."
Did the Tiger King get any reduction?  He's still waiting for Trump to pardon him.
"Semi related topic, remembers those two Death row inmates who had their cases put into doubt by prosecutors themselves, but then were still executed earlier this year, did they figure out if they did commit the crime or not?"
Didn't he pardon the judge selling innocent kids to the prison industrial complex yesterday?
"Agree with this a 100% let them be in prison forever

I have complicated feelings about the death penalty. I believe there are crimes bad enough that you deserve to be executed and lose your life. 

The problem is that our justice system sucks and is unreliable...there are too many innocent people put to death, and until the system can guarantee with a 100% accuracy that no innocent person will be put to death i cant support the death penalty"
"The other three, ""What."" ""The."" ""Fuck."""
"They should die, not live in prison. I don‚Äôt want to pay to sustain them"
"Musk/Trump will not be able to execute the remaining three. The remaining three are early into the long appeals process, and there is no speeding it up. Biden has exactly blocked the Musk/Trump admin from carrying out any executions."
Should give these animals the needle.
"Edit 1: I'm wrong about some facts (I.e. Death sentence saving tax payer dollars) and potentially misleading information around whether or not Biden can commute sentences in appeal status. The law vs what is actually done seems to be different. I don't have the time to do indepth research, but I encourage everyone to do their own research. Do not take my comment as gospel and do not quote me. Do your own research and come to your conclusion as reddit comments can be wrong!

I can't speak for the other 37 cases that were commuted by Biden, but for those frustrated he didn't do all 40...heres a small summary for the 3 excluded:

1. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - Boston marathon bomber. He is still in the middle of an appeal process for whether the jury/prosecution fumbled the case due to the amount of public press it received. So, his sentence over the death sentence is still under appeal and therefore Biden likely couldn't commute a death sentence still under review. 

2. Dylann Roof - church shooter in 2015 that killed 9 people. The Supreme Court denied the appeal. So, either Roof's lawyers are trying again and they're still in appeal review or there is no more room left for them but I could be wrong. If Biden commuted his sentence, it would be against the Supreme courts decision to deny his appeal. Therefore, likely Biden sees the death penalty is warranted due to the Supreme courts decisions or they are still in the middle of another appeal. 

3.  Robert Bowers - killed 11 and injured 7 after a synagogue shooting in 2018. His last appeal in 2023 for a new trial was denied. He likely is appealing to a higher court and still waiting.

I don't obviously understand all of the ins and outs for commuting the death sentence, but it appears as though, in these 3 cases, the president either feels these 3 deserve the death penalty or they are still waiting for a final appeal review and he can't commute their sentence yet"
"It‚Äôs a fascinating bit of mental gymnastics to get to ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt have the death penalty, except for these three guys.‚Äù Really muddles the message."
"Highly disagree. If you end up on federal death row, get fucked."
"This is kinda pro-life of him, no?"
"I know this is serious but....

""37?? In a death row???"""
"Ironically, this will save tax payer money"
Christians that believe in the 10 Commandments support the idea that only God and private health insurance companies have the right to take another‚Äôs life.. not even the life of murderers.
"I have a bit of an issue with this. Either you believe in something or you don't. It seems strange to only commute 37 to life without parole. All 40 have done something horrible, but if you don't believe in the death penalty, then why not commute all 40?"
Clearly no one in this thread is related to their victims (like the two little girls sexually assaulted and stabbed to death while riding their bikes) or have had similar experiences involving a loved one. But that's besides the point.¬†
How often did president's pardon or commute sentences before these last few?
"I‚Äôm blown away by the fact the articles last week chose to highlight how the Boston marathon bomber was one of the eligible prisoners. Now seeing Dylan roof was denied commutation, i can‚Äôt believe the click baiters buried the lede like that"
Imagine being one of the three people not commuted
"If he's opposed to the death penalty on principle, why did those 3 people get excluded?"
The punchline in this story is  ‚ÄúThe Trump administration (34 felony convictions) stands for the rule of law
So what's the story with the other 3?
"Otherwise, Trump would expedite their execution as show of force. He is quite pathetic and predictable in his malignant narcissism even dementia in the mix."
All those ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù fools are losing their minds lol
A true pro-life politician
Can Trump change it back and put them back on deathrow?
"Federal convictions, he can't commute state sentences."
Biden should pardon Luigi. That would be the greatest fuck you in history.
"Literally none of these people should have been commuted. Especially the monster who kidnapped and murdered a 12 year old girl.

What the actual fuck was Biden thinking?Honestly fuck this Progressive bull. If this is the type of people we're letting off the hook, then I have no problem with Trump commuting the Jan 6th people."
And people claim he‚Äôs not a good Catholic
Leave it to reddit to swing from bidens nuts at every opportunity.
"The ones who killed kids, prison guard and cop shouldn‚Äôt have had theirs commuted. You kill a kid you should die. The one who killed the guard will do it again. I mean he knows he is in prison and did it once what would keep him from doing it again."
It‚Äôs a step. The government shouldn‚Äôt be in the murder business.
"No significant notes.  This was the right move.  The death penalty is too dangerously harsh for our imperfect conviction system and life without parole is still punitive.  The other three were just too hot to commute, and I get that.  All the same, now DJT won't have bodies to fry for his wicked little sadistic glee."
Way to go Joe. Let your child rapist friends free
‚ÄúTrump stands by the rule of law‚Äù with all due and I do mean all due respect Suck my ass. He is a convicted felon still awaiting sentencing and owes money for sexually assaulting someone. Next time ask someone a little more credible their opinion on the topic
weird.... i guess im the only one who thinks terrorists AND child killers should get the death penalty

A life in prison is worse than death
"Good. The death penalty is ineffective, overly expensive and convoluted, and has no place in a civilized society. It's a travesty it hasn't been abolished nationwide already. The point of the courts and the criminal justice system is to avoid mob rule, yet the only coherent reason anyone ever seems to cite in defense of the death penalty is ""a lot of people still support it."" A lot of people are fucking stupid, as this last election unequivocally proved."
Len Davis deserves death row
"Return to form. We are not the party of the death penalty.

And if you‚Äôre mad about this, consider life in prison is way worse than the easy way out"
Denying justice for the victims.
"Honest question, why does a supposedly modern country still condemn its citizens to death?

Prison should be used as a form of punishment, but most of all as a means of reintroducing people back into society and giving them a chance at redemption.

*Probably something inconceivable to some people who will read my comment.*"
Who are the 3 he didn't commute?
So those 3 are real bad eggs eh?
Those 3 must be bad dudes
Does this include the guy they were talking to on NPR a couple days ago‚Ä¶?
"Yo, them must be three bad mofos."
As long as there's no possibility of parole or any other appeals that makes the families relive it more than they already do.
So who were the 3 that are gonna got the axe?
actually based joe wow
"Woke up, said, ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm a Catholic,‚Äù and went for it? ¬†Cool."
"Man, did anyone elses eyes just read Joe Biden, skip a few words to death, and thought 2024 was about to get really wild on us?"
"Biden is the pardoner-in-chief. He‚Äôs at 8,000 pardons and commutations, I wonder if he is aiming for 10,000 before leaving."
Joe Biden is going for broke lately!
The three he didn‚Äôt commute must have been utter cunts‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm sure the pro-life crowd will be so happy!!
Sounds like a waste of money
Damn how bad are those 3 people
"That could be a good thing ,30 years more living in a hell on earth .They may have had it easier with death so good one ."
"So, who are the three that Joe thinks should still be murdered?"
Ooof what did the other three fuckin do? Must‚Äôve been bad bad.
im curious what the other 3 did
"Were the sentences commuted to life without parole, or is parole an option?"
Yea a commute is different from a pardon
"And the three exceptions are the three I was hoping he would **not** commute:

‚ÄúDzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted of carrying out the 2013 Boston marathon bombing attack; Dylann Roof, who shot dead nine Black church members in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; and Robert Bowers, who stormed a synagogue in the heart of Pittsburgh‚Äôs Jewish community and killed 11 worshippers in 2018.‚Äù"
"No no, I read on freedomeagle.com that Joe Biden is personally inviting all these murderers to his Delaware beach house to snort coke with Hunter now that they‚Äôre free!11!1

/s"
"But people don‚Äôt know what the word ‚Äòcommute‚Äô means in this context.

So news outlets can take this and warp it to seem like Biden pardoned and freed Death Row inmates."
I had to explain that to my 74yr old mom. He‚Äôs just taking eminent death off their sentence - they‚Äôre forever imprisoned.
"Devil‚Äôs advocate:  at least now, any innocents in that population have a chance to prove it, rather than just die"
"Posted the same thing on a FB thread and immediately got a ‚ÄúWeLl NoW wE hAvE tO pAy FoR tHeM tHe ReSt Of ThIeR LiVeS‚Äù comment.  Republicans, party of life my ass.

Facts don‚Äôt matter to these folks. They saw Biden‚Äôs name and attacked. Why is irrelevant.
"I hate that this has to be expressed. You know damn well there's a bunch of MAGA cultists, at this very moment, whining that Biden set free a bunch of criminals."
"You're Doin the lords work. seriously, so many idiots just skim stuff and get outraged for nothing and spread misinformation"
"Only the Boston Bomber in Florence, it appears that the other two are at Terre Haute, Indiana.  

FWIW, my friend has a son in prison, most likely for life, and she says he is thriving there.  Would she like him out?  Yes but she is in her mid-70's, so it's unlikely she will be alive should he ever be paroled.   It's been 25-30 years for him and he has said he wouldn't want to be released at this point unsure what he would do so support himself.  If his parents were around, things would be different but apparently, life in prison isn't worse than death for him.   I supposed he has been institutionalized like Brooks."
"Possibly. But if this were true, why do clearly guilty inmates like Dylan Roof appeal their sentences?"
"I am opposed to the death penalty for this reason. Life in prison is worse with the added benefit of being more just. I also don't think capital punishment works as a deterrent. Let em rot, I say."
"Alabama, ""THIS IS BULLSHIT, THAT RECORD IS OURS."""
Did that one poor fella in Texas actually save his pecan pie for after his execution because he was slow? Or is that a myth.
Most likely children Ina school but that‚Äôs beside the point
"Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, and Missouri. 

Cali has the most awaiting, surprisingly, but that's really just a result of them putting a moratorium on it and not proceeding"
Better than spending tax payer dollars on them
"It *shouldn‚Äôt* be the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù decision. It *should* be difficult for a government to execute citizens. Really, really fucking bad things happen when they can kill citizens all willy-nilly. Look at how many black boys in the US got legally executed by their government due to flat-out lies from white folks back when it WAS ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to get done. Even the fucking government conceded that some barriers were needed, ffs!!"
I don‚Äôt trust our justice system enough to think the death penalty should exist
"Maybe if its such a problem, the government should save money by abolishing the death penalty like most other 'developed' nations"
"Yes, *that‚Äôs* the problem with the death penalty. Not the whole ‚Äúmurdering innocent people‚Äù aspect."
"I don‚Äôt see that as a problem. We have the means for life imprisonment with a very low likelihood of escape. I think as a society we need to move past killing as punishment. Really sets a bad precedent to say some people are worthy of death. Because everyone is going to take that and draw their own line.

We should see it as completely immoral to kill someone who is not an immediate threat to anyone."
"I‚Äôm not sure this commutation selection can really be said to necessarily suggest what he does/doesn‚Äôt personally support but rather what he thinks he has the political capital to do. If he had commuted all of them, Republicans would put in ads for years to come ‚ÄúDemocrats don‚Äôt even support the death penalty for people like Dylan Roof‚Äù and that would hold sway with a lot of impressionable voters. So even if Biden is against the death penalty in all circumstances, he might not want to commute all the sentences when public opinion isn‚Äôt completely on his side."
"Yes, he already had a moratorium on federal death sentences except for those two cases."
It‚Äôs a political calculation more than what he actually believes. If he did do those then the right would say democrats are soft on terrorism.
"At least in the case of the non-Boston Marathon people, there‚Äôs no way Biden would commute the sentence of the racial based massacres. That would be a political landmine for both Biden and the Democratic Party, and the congressional black caucus surely wouldn‚Äôt stand for it."
as someone who is very anti-death penalty i will not lose sleep over the three who didnt get commuted.
The three that were excluded deserve it.
And they all moved right up to the front of the line
"thankfully, the state does not use the label ""terrorism"" selectively and would never apply it in a biased way"
Research the Channon Christian case and you may feel different.
"This is federal. Luigi did not cop federal terrorism charges, only New York. New York does not have the death penalty"
this made me realize i never knew the name or face of the synagogue shooter
"Good thing the federal government hasn't charged him with terrorism, eh?¬†"
"You're probably right, but Luigi also hasn't been convicted. Did Biden pardon anyone that is awaiting trial?"
He has state charges and not federal. President can‚Äôt pardon state crimes.
"These are three mass murderers. 

Luigi is not a mass murderer.

Republicans have executed likely innocent people.

Don't fall for the bullshit preemptively."
"Why is this getting upvoted???

As others have noted, state vs federal...."
Terrorism is just violence the state didnt approve. - Chomsky
Biden could do the funniest thing.
No Federal prisoners were executed under Biden.
"No.  He commuted thier remaining sentence, as part of a blanket commutation for those that were on house arrest."
"Just to clarify, no. He didn't pardon him, or any of the others that were included in that decision. He commuted their sentences, which is different."
He pardoned all non-violent offenders affected by a Covid early release law. That included the kids for cash judge which ended his house arrest two years early.
"That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at as well, and since 100% accuracy is not achievable in this system we have, I‚Äôm against it."
"I largely agree with what you wrote, but there are consequences for taking the death penalty off the table.  Besides the long term costs of incarceration, prisoners serving life sentences with no hope of parole place a high burden on the guards and staff at prisons. Such prisoners can't be controlled. For example, what punishment can you mete out for such an inmate if that inmate kills another inmate or guard? He/she is already doing life behind bars.  With the death penalty off the table, there is no additional penalty that can be imposed without treading on the cruel and unusual."
Well instead you‚Äôre paying for them to file multiple appeals so pick your poison
"You‚Äôre going to pay as much as $1m more trying to kill them, for as many decades as their appeals can last. Life in prison is cheaper and worse."
Life without parole is cheaper than death penalty. Botched executions are extremely expensive. As are the various lawsuits and everything else that goes on during a death penalty run up.
"Dylan roof would be just barely safe. The Boston bomber probably isn't. His case is well known, and there really are no unknowns or avenues to introduce evidence not already known. If Trump puts a priority on death penalty cases to finish up (if he is trying to get the federal budget under control, it is a good first place to look), he probably does not have 4 years of appeals left."
"I understand some death row inmates are innocent, but these are Federal inmates. I would assume guilt is pretty clear in most of these cases."
They're not free. They will still spend the rest of their lives in jail. It does not overturn the guilty verdict; just spares their lives.
the pardon power has no restrictions. he could pardon any of those at any time or commute their sentence the moment it was imposed.
The death penalty never saves anyone money
"I'm honestly surprised Len Davis and Kaboni Savage each got a commutation. 

Both are really bad dudes. To put it mildly. The details of each of their cases have always stood out to me for the sheer depravity. These are men that aren't just violent themselves, but have a capability to get others to do their bidding. They're not just hard, they're intelligent. 

Hope ADX has at least two more open beds for them. These are guys that can be a threat from within the system."
">Biden likely couldn't commute a death sentence still under review.

Pardon/commutation power is unilateral. Trump pardoned several people who were appealing their sentence. Ford pardoned Nixon before there was even an indictment. 

I'm downvoting because claiming Biden \*can't\* commute the sentences is bad information. 

Also, it's pretty established fact that the death penalty doesn't save the state money. Life without Parole is traditionally much cheaper than the death penalty. 

Biden's reasoning here is pretty clear- Terrorism is the line."
It‚Äôs not really a stretch to say that we should have the death penalty for some crimes but not others
"Well‚Ä¶they were mass murders, with terrorist and hate crime charges as well."
"So many people defending biden singlehandedly determining 3 people deserve to be sentenced to death, despite all 40 being legally convicted and sentenced"
"Except for the large number of people who were released from death row after it was shown they were innocent? 

What is the acceptable ratio of innocent people to guilty getting put to death for you? 1 innocent person for every 10 guilty? 1 out of 100?"
Try not to commute any sentences on your way to the parking lot!
"The ‚Äúno death penalty‚Äù belief is strictly a New Testament related idea. Nothing to do with the 10 commandments. In fact, if you actually read the Old Testament books related to Jewish law directly after the 10 commandments are passed down, there are quite a number of ways that Jewish law allows a person to be executed."

Some of the victim's relatives named in the article said they supported the move because they see life imprisonment as harsher.

Presidents can't pardon somebody who haven't been convicted of a crime yet. So it's pretty much guaranteed they're not going to even get started on Luigi's case until Trump is in office. Not that Biden would pardon Luigi anyways.
Only sane comment.
"They're being commuted to life without parole. 

They're going to spend the rest of their lives waking up staring at the same concrete wall day after day for years. Which is exactly what several of the victims families wanted in the first place except prosecutors pushed for the death penalty because it looks good on their resumes. 

They're not getting off the hook, they're getting to spend the rest of their lives slowly rotting away and fading into obscurity eating the same dog shit day in and day out, experiencing the exact same unchanging routine year after year. And just slowly whittle away into nothingness. 

There's a really good chance that a lot of them won't even make it that long. A lot of very violent inmates are actually extremely loving older brothers and they're not going to take kindly to somebody who killed a little girl."
They will spend the rest of their lives in prison. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve been freed.
"‚ÄòLetting off the hook‚Äô by still remaining in prison for life, that‚Äôs some kinda logic you got there.¬†"
... but these guys weren't wrongfully convicted.
"Hey, Biden himself started his admin off with a bang by killing 7 Afghan kids for no good reason. So he gets where they're coming from."

You can't introduce mass muderers back into society.... Bozo take
"There are different theories on the purpose of the justice system. Reform/redemption is one. You also have punishment, deterrence, and public safety. 

I don‚Äôt support the death penalty myself. But it‚Äôs not hard for me to understand why someone might conceivably support it as punishment, deterrence or as a means to put a stop to the worst of the worst."
"Because we tried it the other way in the 60s and 70s, and weren't particularly rewarded for it.

Personally, I think Alphonse Karr said it best: ‚ÄúIf we want to abolish the death penalty, let our friends the murderers take the first step.‚Äù"
"Roof (who committed a mass shooting/hate crime in a AME church), Tsaranev (the Boston Marathon bomber) and Bowers (the Tree of Life synagogue shooter.)"
"Extremely bad. Like, not even a debate"
All the commutions are from death penalty to life without parole. Several of the victim's families never even wanted the death penalty in the first place because they saw it as a cheap and easy escape from punishment. The son of the woman who was murdered by the drug ring cop specifically said he looks forward to knowing that on the cops 95th birthday he's going to be looking at the same concrete walls that he's been looking at for the last however many years.
"Shot up a church on racial grounds, shot up a synagogue on antisemitic grounds, and bombed a marathon.   Yeah, they‚Äôre too hot to touch even with life imprisonment in solitary confinement as an alternative."
"The racist kid who shot up a Black church bible study in Charlestown, an antisemite who shot up the Pittsburgh synagogue, and the Boston Marathon bomber."
"Boston Marathon bomber

Dylan Roof church shooter

Bowers synagogue shooter"
"Yeah. Instead of being killed they have to spend their lives commuting, a fate worse than death in my opinion. Biden gave a harsh sentence."
"Commuting a sentence could also be used to eliminate imprisonment, so you need to specify the details. For example, Trump initially commuted Roger Stone‚Äôs sentence just before he was to report to prison (he later pardoned him)."
"Exactly. Although my commute to work feels like a death sentence, it‚Äôs very much a life sentence."
"""Fuck these three guys in particular."""

"I think the devil is probably pro killing innocents rather than the guilty, angels advocate maybe?"
"On death row they have a guaranteed number of appeals and resources to do that. 

Now they are not on death row, can they afford to since they are no longer guaranteed by the state?"
Also isn't life imprisonment less costly than the death penalty anyway? All the appeals and whatnot that occur throughout the death penalty process costs more.  Google says on average it is $1mil more costly per inmate to carry out the death penalty than life imprisonment.
"If you were to propose that government assistance would only be available to 'real americans', they would all turn into socialists over night."
"Oh my mistake, I assumed all 3 were at ADX.

I definitely get life at other prisons could often (or even usually?) be preferable to death.

But ADX specifically, solitary for 23 hours a day in a silent cube... that sounds like a very long torture until death... at least for me."
"I have a nephew who is a complete mess. Drugs, homelessness, assault. We have tried so many times to help him but he is violent and he chooses life on the streets. He is the same as your friends son. When he's picked up and held he detoxes and gets a regimented schedule he has to follow and he does so much better. As soon as they release him he goes straight back to drugs and crime."
Not only what he would do to support himself but how would he be able to acclimatize back into society. The US is not typically known for its robust support system for released convicts.
Death row inmates were polled once and asked if they‚Äôd rather be executed or stay in prison for the rest of their lives with no chance of parole and the majority chose the latter. It takes an awful lot for someone to choose death over life.
"Death row appeals are automatic as far as I know. You can waive them, but if you don‚Äôt then they just go ahead until all appeals have been exhausted."
Often in the hope that some procedural error is uncovered which would allow them a retrial or to push for a life sentence over the death penalty.
"Dylann Roof isn‚Äôt at ADX, he‚Äôs at USP Terre Haute"
"I donno. Something to do with nothing but time? Looking for a symbolic ""victory"" or just fighting the system? Hope ""success"" could lead to a new attack on the conviction itself?"
"The Fifth Amendment says to the federal government that no one shall be ‚Äúdeprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.‚Äù This is the ultimate deprivation of that.  They‚Äôll always get their day in court."

Aren't they just slavers in Alabama? Can't lease prisoners out as labor in fast food and hotels if you kill them.

"Yeah, CA has a long proud tradition of sentencing lots of people to death and never executing any of them. The people have repeatedly voted to continue capital punishment whenever it's put to a state ballot measure, but everyone they actually vote into office is opposed to it. Quoting Whitman:

> Do I contradict myself?  
Very well then I contradict myself,  
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)"
It should just not be an option
My point exactly. One's ideological position on death penalty is immaterial. It's just impractical.
"In order to support the death penalty, you have to also have complete, 100% confidence that the government will never make a mistake and get something wrong. Otherwise you run the risk of murdering an innocent citizen. 

I personally do *not* have that level of faith in our government and find it highly problematic that there is a way for the government to legally kill its citizens. I'm kinda blown away that anyone is cool with that, honestly."
"Really, you'd think we'd find more efficient ways to just have the state execute people. If we really put some thought into it we could pop off a few dozen a day. Maybe hundreds. Damn shame about all that due process /s"
"When dealing with people who don't value human life in any capacity, the financial argument is not that bad."
"Republicans wouldn't have used Dylan Roof as their example, they would use the Boston bomber because he better fits their terrorist stereotype"
"""democrats want to coddle murdering rapists"". see you can build an effective attack ad out of any of these commutations."
"The other side is that they can no longer respond to any of them by saying it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre against the death penalty on principle, since they were commuted selectively."
Joe Biden has political capital?
And the Boston marathon bomber
Yeah I prefer the death penalty to be abolished but I'm not going to hold these three up as the champions of death penalty abolition.
I think this is how Biden feels as well. It would just feel gross to touch those cases.
"I am fundamentally opposed to the death penalty, but I‚Äôm fine with these 3 still being there. I live in Pittsburgh and knew the daughter of the married couple who was killed during the Tree of Life shooting. I also happened to be in the shelter in place zone around the synagogue that day. I was teaching a yoga class and there were sirens going non-stop the entire time, and it wasn‚Äôt until I looked at my phone at the end of class that I saw what was happening. I had to tell everyone as they were in a very relaxed (and honestly, kind of vulnerable feeling) state. I‚Äôm still fucked up from that day. 

And I have a friend who was volunteering in rhe post-race area after the finish line of the Boston Marathon the year of the bombing. She‚Äôs also fucked up from it.

Totally fine with Bowers, Roof, and Tsarnaev not getting their sentences commuted."
"I'm anti-death penalty. I live in a country with no death penalty, and am happy that way. Given how much murder there is in America, I don't think it is an effective deterrent. 

I wouldn't specifically campaign for these guys. Maybe if the evidence around the case was suspect? I don't know the cases. I would definitely support an overall law change even if it meant these guys weren't killed though."
"Let's be honest here: they *all* ""deserved it."" There are no philanthropists on death row!"
The Feds did charge Luigi though. It's still unknown if they will seek the death penalty for him...
Good.  We shouldn‚Äôt.  May his name be wiped from the earth.
"Considering there are groups literally worshipping him as a ""saint""... Including that girl who shot up a school the other day...

Good I'm glad! Keep it up."
"They will if his trial ends with not guilty or a nullified/hung jury. They'll handle this with the same playbook they did with Black Panthers, let the states try to figure it out and keep their hands clean unless they can't ""get the job done""."
well no one has ever been charged with terrorism as thst isn't a federal crime; as in there is no such statute.
Yes. He pardoned Hunter during an ongoing prosecution and added that it applied to anything he had ever done between 2014 and the date of the pardon.
I don't think that's possible. Edit: Seems I was wrong. See here: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-considers-preemptive-pardons-experts-constitutional/story?id=116505853.
He has some fed charges as well
Because this website is incapable of discussing any criminal story without making it about Luigi Mangione.
He commuted the sentences of those people.  Not pardoned.  Meaningful distinction to be made there.
Also it's worth noting that he followed the requests of the ACLU to a T for his pardons.
Hard to botch a bullet to the head
"I guess I feel like, others that listened to all the evidence decided what these inmates did was so heinous that they forfeited the right to live. That can‚Äôt have been done lightly. I just hope the President thought about that."
How much do you think it cost to off Epstein vs imprison him forever? I'm sure we could get the price down to $100 if we just hired the cheapest contractor with their sharpened toothbrush¬†
"It seems like many people support this. I don't have a staunch opinion on this, but I think that they should never be free."
"Totally agree! But the president is saying ‚Äúwe should stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level,‚Äù while still reserving the death penalty for a few people. Which is pretty much how the death penalty has always been, and probably will always be."
We shouldn‚Äôt have it at all. But that would take an act of congress to change.
"And one person should have the right to determine who lives and dies? All 40 were convicted by a jury, but Biden feels he has the right to determine which of those is actually worthy of death"
Were none of the other 37 mass murders? What's the line a terrorist? How do you define that. Seems odd.
"No, it‚Äôs because their commutation would be extremely unpopular with Democrats. It‚Äôs entirely political."
"Yes. Awful people, to be sure, just seems odd to qualify your opposition to the death penalty by reserving it for the worst of the worst, when that‚Äôs pretty much been the justification for keeping it for decades."
"I'm trying to ignore it to enjoy the holidays, my friend."
"Life is life, right? Practice what you preach.¬†"
"That's because you're a rational human being capable of logical thought. The problem with people on the extreme ends of the spectrum is that they cannot even fathom the other viewpoint. In this example, OP just assumes the ""reform/redemption"" theory as obviously the theory we use but are just barbarically behind on implementation. They can't even fathom that others wouldn't agree."
"Well, my country has been living well without sentencing people to the death penalty for almost 200 years. We don't have ""life in prison"" sentences either. But we also have crime; we just treat our criminals differently, and perhaps we also educate our citizens differently."
The boston marathon shooter isn‚Äôt already dead???
"Especially if they have to drive through Tyson's Corner in DC. It's aptly named ""the Devil's butthole"" for a reason."
"We got full RTO earlier this year, triggered"
"Is that why the majority of people facing the death penalty do their best to plead for life without parole? Cut the crap.

Edit-this joke went over my head, oops"
Considering we have murdered people who we later found did not commit the crime. Death penalty should only be used in the most extreme cases.
"I‚Äôve always seen life without parole as a worse punishment than execution. It‚Äôs still a death sentence, but one that will drag on for decades, with little freedom, until nature takes its course

And it comes with the added benefit of increasing the odds for innocent people to be freed. Once an innocent person is executed, there‚Äôs no going back"
"Jokes on you, Biden loves a good commute."
I heard that Lector is a really great guy from the other President.
That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre dangerous idiots.
Don't think the devil would care. The point of the devil is convincing people to be evil not killing them.
"And yet, we still execute innocent people all the time anyway."
I find this argument only works half the time. The other half just decides we should get rid of the appeals process and just shoot people immediately after trial.
Yes... But its not an Apple to Apples comparison... The vast expansion in Life without parole sentencing has probably undone much of the real financial benefit to Death penalty abolitionism...  Its not being used as responsible replacement for capital punishment.. Its being used as a genericized punishment for all kinds of crimes...
The choice between death penalty and life imprisonment isn‚Äôt a cost benefit exercise
"A fair assumption but it's for that exact reasons you describe why I oppose a place like Florence.

Yes, I get it, El Chapo or a mob boss might try to run their operation out of prison or might have someone break them out and Robert Hanssen (the spy) who might have secret info to spill but is Ted Kaczynski really a national security threat?  Does he have a mob of anarchists that are going to scale the prison walls and help him escape?  Nah, it's just torture and vengeance.

I guess I take more of a Norwegian prison approach where even Anders Breivik (the guy who killed 69 kids) is treated humanely.  They even have prison staff who interact with him to ensure that even a depraved member of a social species is not without any contact.  But good heavens, I hope the staff get combat pay for having to deal with him."
Usually they don't keep them at ADX for the entire sentence. It's typically for 1-2 years if they're causing problems in max security prisons. They're typically rotated in and out. But some rare exceptions can be made. But it's not like 20 years in a cell for 23 hours a day.
"I used to be like this. One day in a homeless shelter, I heard the exact sentence I needed to look at my life differently. It planted a seed and I am a very different person today. I hope your nephew hears what he needs one day."
I wonder if your nephew would have benefited from military service?
I mean after years living there would become normal to them.
"Which is why I‚Äôve always found it bizarre when a criminal kills themselves before being caught people are like ‚Äúblah blah blah cowards way out.‚Äù I would never want to call a psycho killer brave, but we‚Äôre hardwired by billions of years of evolution to want to live over all else, so not a exactly a cowardly move either."
"It takes depression, generally.

Most people don't consider death as an option unless there is something medically wrong with them, mentally or physically. Even in grim circumstances."
Hmm. I wonder how many are aware of the off brand chemical cocktails that go into lethal injections because name brand pharmaceuticals don‚Äôt want their bottom line associated with the death penalty. Give me the nitrogen.
Especially when there‚Äôs currently no consistently successful humane method for executing prisoners
"Yes, they're automatic. The process to drop them is lengthy. Tim McVeigh would be the most recent example of that at the federal level"
His question was why would people want life in prison over death
"I thought Tsaranev was there too but you are right, just Bowers and Roof are.  I assume they would have moved them all there.

In college, I did a few volunteer trips to serve inmates meals at Terre Haute with church groups (they did not let us serve the death row inmates) and let me tell you, that is not a place someone wants to spend their whole life.  Or even a year.  I think those who have not visited a prison outside of the visitors halls have a vision of prison that is actually way rosier than it is.  Life in that place is definitely not an easy sentence."
"No, but it is an angle that appeals to those who support capital punishment"
If people were honest they would admit incarceration is more about punishment than deterrence and rehabilitation. It sure doesn't do the latter two things based on recidivism rates.
Although your links points out it was in Arkansas
It shouldn‚Äôt. But it is. It shouldn‚Äôt get EASIER.
"It‚Äôs wild to me that there is a not insignificant number of people in the US who simply can accept that occasionally innocent people will be executed, and that‚Äôs just the price we have to pay to keep the death penalty as an option. They‚Äôre so committed to capital punishment that they‚Äôre fine with the prospect of innocent citizens being murdered by the state."
"It‚Äôs not about that. People want bread and circus. So the death penalty gives a lot of people satisfaction in a revengeful kind of way. 

It‚Äôs not about justice, it never was."
"Just go the whole way to Judge Dredd, that seems the most efficient way!"
They would have used Dylan Roof in attempt to create a wedge issue between Democrats and black voters.
Republicans just instead put them in charge
"You absolutely can, but it would have been a lot easier for terrorists that already have name/crime  recognition with the public like Dylan Roof and the Boston Marathon bomber"
Does that really sound like a line of attack that might come out of a republicans mouth? Be serious

"No, he is 12 years deep into appeals.  The process is very long.

That's worse than what I do to tortured souls!"
Good god‚Ä¶
"He said ""commuting"" as a pun meaning traveling for work. Obviously life wirhout parole does not involve commuting."
death penalty should never be used. ‚Äúthe most extreme cases‚Äù can and would be expanded to include whatever the state doesnt like.
"This is the really important thing. No one is asking for killers to go free, but there are lots of issues with the death penalty that make a morally reprehensible thing for a nation to do and I don't want my tax dollars going to ending the lives of people who may very well be innocent in the end. If we kill them now and find out they're innocent later, it'll be too late.

And that's why Biden should commute these death sentences. We don't do a lot of these federally because we have recognized that this is wrong and we shouldn't be doing it.

But moving into Trump's second term, we'll ramp up the death penalty for federal death row inmates because we all know who Trump is. This is the same man who took out a full page ad in thr NYT demanding the Central Park 5 be given the death penalty and who, to this day, refuses to acknowledge their innocence despite exoneration on DNA evidence."

"The only time incarceration should be about ""punishment"" is for the crimes in which it is permanent. Either it's for rehabilitation and you are... well. rehabilitated, or you're so dangerous to society your imprisonment is literally just to keep you away from it - in which case rehabilitating won't do anything and you should never be let out."
Countries with lower recidivism rates tend to have better living conditions for inmates.

"Yeah jury nullification is a fool's wish here. You won't get 12 out of 12 people to vote not guilty if they can prove he is in fact guilty. The most likely verdict will probably be guilty, and after that it'd be a hung jury and a re-trial."
Exactly. Especially in a case where there's no reasonable doubt about whether he killed someone.

"I lived in each of them too. I agree with Honolulu. I‚Äôd drive from the ala Moana area to the north shore, which is like 20-25 minutes without traffic, and it would take me 2-3 hours routinely.

"You may have just come up with the best alternative to imprisomment. Weld a guy into a car driven by AI that he can't force to crash or do anything dangerous, with radio tuned to NPR or Alex Jones (depending on political affiliation) and force them to commute through the most congested parts of LA traffic all day long, for the rest of their lives. Only allowed to leave when it's returned to a prison for refuel and bathroom break (if they make it through traffic)

I always want to get off somewhere along the line and take an exit hoping I can just drive another hour out of my way in another direction and get to the same place and my family always talks me out of it.

Well yes but convincing them to do evil for their personal gain is pretty much the primary method. Besides if you read the shit god does.... No devil required really.

Exactly this. This is why murder‚Äìsuicide happen so much. It's a mentally ill person who wants to take as much people out before they commit their suicide attempt.
"Iirc he actually took it further and called our service members in the Middle East cowards for some reason in the same rant, and that‚Äôs what people were most upset about.

"Despite its incredibly dystopian nature, the USSR I'd argue actually had fairly humane executions. You just get taken to a room, and before you really know what's happening, they put a bullet in the back of your head.

"If you freak out at your execution, the last thing you want is a precision-based weapon that doesn't kill you in most cases.

The difference between veterinary euthanasia and the death penalty is that veterinarians generally support the idea that euthanasia must sometimes be used. Vets are the best possible people for the job of helping an animal to pass painlessly, and they are willing to do it.

Doctors don't want to administer the death penalty. Pharma companies do not want to be known to sell materials for executions. The politicians who want the death penalty are not the people who are capable of administering it, and every possible innovation in humane executions in the US is hindered by the fact that a cruel and **usual** execution method is legal, but an **unusual** execution method that turns out to be cruel is a crime."
Or eaten an egg salad s and which from a gas station.
no prob. sometime people get stuck in the system and end up doing way more time there than they should. it's a horrible situation
"This would be capital-eligible murder if the AG decides to pursue the death penalty (which again, is likely under Trump).  The only requirement is that defendent murdered with 'life threatening intent' and isn't a child/incompetent (see https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42095).



I still think it's low odds he actually gets sentenced to death.  A jury would have to unanimously vote for death in a sentencing trial, and even one objection would result in Life (not a retrial).  But Trump will 100% pursue it."
"Yup, allegedly by 2028 but that will come and go"
"Pretty common glitch, unfortunately"

"Lol, why do you expect to hold onto your humanity if your scientifically verifiable body is dead and your magical true essence backup recording made from air found in God's lungs (or whatever a soul is supposed to be) fast travels to the Elemental Plane of Eternal Torture, where it has a whole team of ex-angels micromanage its suffering?"
"I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. And you‚Äôre right. Those years weren‚Äôt even the worst years of my life health wise, lol. But I‚Äôm still here because I want to live. It‚Äôs just crazy, there seems like no limit to how much humans can suffer and NOT die. 

Best thing about my illnesses was being unconscious sometimes when it got really bad, and having terrible memory. That lack of lucidity made everything a blur."
See I figured sing sing closed because of how old timey it is
We‚Äôve been driving Honda civics for 20+ years. I seriously hope they maintain their reliability
I get what's in this deal for Nissan but what's in it for Honda?
I'd be okay with it if Honda is 100% in charge of every decision ever made.
"Welp, either Honda reliability is about to take a nosedive, or Nissan is about to get a lot better (expensive)"
Day 1:  Fire anyone to do with Nissan transmissions.  They've been the weak link in Nissans for decades.
"Article highlights:

>The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. 
>
>Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will pursue unifying their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. The aim is to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal and list the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by August 2026, he said.
>
>...
>
>On Monday, NIssan's Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6 per cent. They jumped more than 20 per cent after news of the possible merger broke last week. 
>
>Honda's shares surged 3.8 per cent. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20 per cent in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.

>The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation.

It will be interesting to see both the process of this merger as it proceeds, and its eventual impacts on the indutrial/manufacturing sectors in Japan and globally."
"Didn‚Äôt realize until now when I stopped to think about it, just how many automakers there are in Japan. Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Suzuki (although not very relevant to the US)"
The continuing trend of massive companies merging to freate even more massive companies concerns me.
"Watch Nissan become the budget Honda brand.   

Kia - Hyundai - Genesis 

Nissan - Honda - Acura 

Scion (defunct) - Toyota - Lexus


They‚Äôve all done it."
"Really the only logical option.  Nissan was rapidly running out of cash, and I doubt Nissan wanted another experience of being partially owned by a European manufacturer after what happened under Ghosn."
I'm looking forward to seeing Nondas on the road.
Are we thinking ‚ÄúNonda‚Äù or ‚ÄúHissan‚Äù?
"What most people are failing to see is that Nissan is a lot more than a car company, their car sector is just a tiny part of their umbrella.
They also make 

Commercial Vehicles:
	Trucks
	Buses
	
Marine Products:
	Outboard motors for boats
	Engines for marine applications
	
Industrial Equipment:
	Forklifts
	Material handling equipment
	Electric Vehicle Components:
	Batteries and EV-related technology

Aerospace and Defense:
	Nissan has been involved in producing aerospace components and vehicles, as well as defense equipment in collaboration with other companies.

	Technology and Software:
           Research and development in     autonomous driving technology, connectivity, and artificial intelligence."
"Fuck, more Altima drivers inbound."
"Man, hope we don't get a Boeing-McDonnell Douglas situation."
"Someone educate me, doesn't Japan have some anti-trust laws against this?"
Never ever again will I own a Nissan. Piece of shit transmission cost me about 5 years worth of car ownership.
"I think this finally means the eventual formal death of Infiniti. Long overdue with how much they've neglected the brand. 

I don't see room for Acura and Infiniti under the same leadership, far too much redundancy, fighting for the same relatively small target customer group."
This would be OK if Honda makes the Nissan part not suck but it'll likely be the Nissan part making Honda suck.
"Is the alliance of Renault, Mitsubishi, and Nissan still a thing?"
The hell could this possibly do for Honda? Nissan is.clearly the one struggling.
Well hopefully Nissan adapts Honda reliability and engineering and not the other way around
Ah. Taking the McDonell Douglas approach. Honda's quality is about to plummet faster than Boeing's did.
Introducing! The Honda Leaf Blower! The Datsun Accord!
Seems like a risky merger for Honda.
Hopefully they get Honda build quality out of it and not Nissan.. Nissan's QC has crumbled since like 2010
"As a Honda owner, I hate everything about this. Honda makes an incredibly reliable car."
What does this mean for r/NissanDrivers ?!
This is never good for the consumer
"Consolidation continues. Global Roaring 20's. Fucking hate this stuff, we're going to squeeze the consumer and consolidate with no other options until it breaks. And it is breaking."
"Lord have mercy I wish there were rules in place to prevent mergers of companies over a certain price tag in competing markets.

There have been charts demonstrating how like 5 companies own 100 different brands and choice is really just an illusion. 

Competition really hardly exists these days."
Let‚Äôs hope Nissan doesn‚Äôt pull a Lockheed-Martin and tank Honda into the ground.  Rule #1 Bury the Nissan CVT under a volcano and never speak of it again.
Now they just need to rebrand as a tech company and boom an extra 100x valuation
"he merger between Honda and Nissan to create the world's third-largest automaker marks a significant shift in the automotive industry. In an era where companies need to adapt to the rise of electric vehicles and intensifying competition, this alliance could provide them with the resources necessary to compete with giants like Tesla and Volkswagen.

What‚Äôs particularly interesting is that both brands will retain their identity while combining efforts to develop electric vehicles, autonomous driving software, and share components."
"So glad I just bought a 2022 Honda Civic Sport Hatchback before they go changing everything. It‚Äôs a sweet car, and at my age, it should last me the rest of my life."
"""Merge"" is a strong word in this case."
the paper work will all be done of the paper tags
"Nissan is owned by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance,So where does Honda fit in here. It‚Äôs not a merger it‚Äôs a takeover"
Honda + Nissan = Honda-san
Does this mean an NSX GTR?  üòÅ
"Mark my words, Mazda and Toyota are next"
Is this the Japanese government forcing Honda to bail out Nissan?
Why would you tie yourself to a sinking ship?
Courts shouldn‚Äôt allow this merger.
Does this mean reliability will even out and be mediocre?
The world of mega corporations grow ever closer
Oh boy I sure love consolidating powers
"Hondissan or Nishonda. 

You can only choose one."
"Honda and Toyota should of merged, I want a car to outlast the world on 1 oil change."
But what does it mean for Mazda?
"People trying to guess what will be the name. And here i am thinking it‚Äôd be funny if they just settle with NiHon, which literally means Japan."
I vote for worse thing to happen to Honda.
Do we get a Honda Frontier based Passport?
"Please please please don‚Äôt change a thing about the Honda civic. 

Sincerely, everyone who drives one."
Been thinking about doing a trade in for a Frontier.  Maybe I should wait for the Honda Frontier?
"Will they name the alliance, Ho-san?"
"Oh yeah, competitors tune capitalism..."
What do you think sounds better? Hossan or Nisda?
"Honsan, Nisda, HondaSan, Nissada?"
I have a Nissan Altima and it‚Äôs held up very well for 9 years. I wonder what their future vehicles will be
I'd buy an Infiniti car if it had Honda build quality and reliability.
"Other than there is now one less manufacturer to compete with this, I hope honda only takes their tech and patents and nothing else.  Gut nissan's process and leadership."
"The nicest interior of a car that I have owned was a 2013 Nisan Leaf.  Heated leather seats front and back, heated steering wheel, Bose sound system, 360 view of the car with cameras.  Damn good car, bad ev mileage."
Honda just gotta take those trucks. Bring back the hard body too
"Nida?
Honsan?
Sanda?
Nihon?"
"I heard something about competition once, doesn't seem to adhere to its mantra."
Ooooh I want a type r skyline Datsun 510 throwback!
Aren't a lot of Nissan's engines french at the moment because of their Renault ties?
"Aw, what the fucking hell?! Why is this shit allowed to happen? 2 giant car companies, neither needs the merger to survive. All this does is take one competitor off the market. Mergers like this should be illegal. Period. It's a complete violation of the fundamental ideas of capitalism. Capitalism doesn't work if you allow those with the largest market shares to consolidate their share of the market like this."
Give me an s2000 with a GTR drivetrain‚Ä¶. PLEASE!!!!
Nissan has been flailing and drowning for a while now and there was that big public spat with the Renault merging due to culture difference. Latching to Honda will be a much needed rescue attempt and Honda gets to use Nissan‚Äôs EV tech
"Oh, alright. I guess I will add Honda to the no-buy list then."
"25 years ago Honda used to sell a lot more cars in Europe.  However a series of ugly and overpriced cars caused them to lose a lot of business to the Korean car companies,  resulting in the closure of their only European car factory."
They should make nissan vtc patrols again the middle east buys it like water
I drive a Nissan Micra 2010 the one with the large headlights. 172km (106miles) on the clock no major parts replaced. Amazing little car
"If this means a Nissan Frontier-based Ridgeline to go toe to toe with the abomination that is the 4th gen Tacoma (I say this as a Tacoma owner and a Taco fanboy shitbag), then I'm all in. That 3.8 in the Frontier is nice and peppy and it's an NA V6 rather than a turbo 4 *and* it redlines at 7k."

I guess this merger makes sense."
So do we call it Ho-niss?
Drove Honda my whole life they are incredibly reliable and cheap to fix. I really really hope this doesn‚Äôt change that.
Think Hondas will go up in price or down in price? Because they are stupid overpriced.
"Oh no... I'm probably not going to buy Honda anymore after this. Nissan is so bad, really."
"I suspect this will not be good for consumers but to be real my Honda has gone strong for 26 years with only slightly major work.

The Japanese sure know how to build a rock solid machine"
So Honda about to be full of Renault parts eh?
What will the new corporation call itself?  Honsan? Nissda?
Bring back the original (pre-2016) INFINITI V6!
Can‚Äôt wait to order a Honsin GT-R-NSX
"Two companies without a clue of how to make a competitive EV doesn't create a company that does.

Watching Honda fail to get a clue for the last 5 years has been painful."
"Where is the anti-trust law!? Come on governments... this is fucking embarrassing. Pretty soon we'll have only two companies in the whole world, brawndo and costco."
"Another merger of equals.
One of these equals is going to die soon."
"Damn, goodbye Honda quality. RIP"
All mergers are anticompetitive. All mergers hurt consumers. All mergers should be illegal.
Mergers are always bad. Always. Unless a company would go out of business without the merger. And most of the time companies say that for justification but it's straight up not true.
I rode my 2001 civic further than I could ever expect out of a car. My 2019 Insight has had almost no problems too
"You're misinterpreting what this merger accomplishes.  Nissan isn't going to have any say or influence on Honda's overall quality.   

This merger is saving Nissan from bankruptcy, and by combining developmental resources their goal is to produce more affordable electrified vehicles in the future."
"[Fuck your Honda Civic, I've a horse outside.](https://youtu.be/ljPFZrRD3J8?si=_QCYLgdfyGK-RwjI)"
"No reason to adopt vehicles and mechanicals that nobody wants. Honda is doing just fine with their lineup. 

This deal is probably more focused on keeping Nissan afloat & taking what's best from their EV & truck departments as Nissan keeps business as usual. 

If anything i wouldn't be surprised to see Honda oversee a overhaul on Nissan's quality assurance."
"I still drive my civic 2020. Single owner, best purchase ever.


edit : Not 2020, 2000!  25 years single owner."
So‚Ä¶1 Honda Civic?
"As an automotive technician, all I'll drive is Hondas. My 09 civic hybrid has got 340k on it and I've seriously have had no issues."
They are mechanically reliable but their garbage paint jobs and rust problems will stop me from ever owning one again.
I hope your right. Because so refuse to drive a Nissan due to the lack of promised warranty or spare parts.
I have Nissans 1st gen electric and after 10 years nothing but tire and break changes. So with Hondas reliability and Nissan reliability we may get something really good.Before the Nissan o had a  1984 Toyota Carola that a friend still drives that will not die. It had even been rolled banged out fine.Asian cars are just built different literally.
They won't.  That's how enshittification works
"I used to work at a car salvage yard around 95. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon that we had Honda civics, Volkswagen golfs, Hyundai ponys that had 500000km on them and would still operate fine if they had not been write offs due to accident damage."
"The Hondasan Civentra?

The Nissanda Centric?"
Honda Element since 2007. I thought I was special.
Hondas are just behind Toyota for reliability and ease of care. It would be a shame if they go the way of Boeing
"Hello Boeing and General Dynamics!

Bet you can‚Äôt wait for that disposable CVT in your 2026 Civic!"
"They have turbos and CVT's so forget about it. I know someone who just turned in a 2017 Civic a with a bad head gasket burning oil, replaced it with a Subaru Crosstrek. \*facepalm\*"
"Honda is in the driver‚Äôs seat on this one, so its shareholders benefit from immediately acquiring a big chunk of the automotive market at a favorable price, relative to what it would be if Nissan wasn‚Äôt in a death spiral, operational efficiency given substantial redundancies between the two automakers, and selective absorption of R&D. 

The second point clearly entails layoffs, attrition, and special charges. 

I‚Äôd venture Honda will also receive a number of financial and/or regulatory favors from the Japanese government, for having averted a very messy bankruptcy restructuring."
"They get a new chunk of market share, additional factories, etc... Not sure what patents/tech Nissan has, but they may have something Honda wants.  Eventually they can streamline both brands by using common chassis/parts, cutting costs.

And they get it fairly cheap, considering the position Nissan is in."
"Nissan has years and years of experience with EV tech, that seems to have never made it to North America. 

There‚Äôs the full electric Leaf, the whole ePower hybrid line (electric drive with a petrol motor as a power generator, used in everything from the Note to X-Trail), then the more sports oriented Hybrid setup in the Nissan Skyline (Infiniti Q50). 

Honda has done some‚Ä¶ interesting hybrid system, but their go-to dual clutch system seems to leave owners more confused and annoyed than happy, then you get the wildness that is the manual transmission hybrid in the CR-Z. 

Mitsubishi has been borrowing Nissans electric knowledge for a few years now, and the PHEV seem to be going pretty well in the markets they‚Äôve released them in (here in New Zealand is one such market). 

Big new headlines, sure, but I can actually see this being a long term net positive for all companies involved. They are facing massive competition from Chinese companies, time to team up, avoid going under, and kick ass."
"An in house EV platform that‚Äôs fully developed, market share in developing nations, an actual truck platform."
"Honda has been dragging their feet on EV technology, even though they were once the leader with their hybrid technology.  Nissan is actually ahead of them there (not that they are leaders, either, but they do at least have a few EVs).  Nissan also brings a full-size SUV (the Armada), something Honda has long been missing, as they topped out with the midsize crossover Pilot."
"Honda gets Nissan‚Äôs new EV platform that the Ariya and all future models are based on. Honda already had a partnership with Nissan so this would just be a more solidified relationship.

And for those that don‚Äôt know: China is destroying Honda (and almost all of the Japanese automakers) in the Chinese domestic market due to the lack of EV options. It‚Äôs a huge shift and Honda now has a shortcut to make up time."
Probably the EVs Nissan has & trucks.  Their titan & frontier trucks are way better than the Ridgelines ever were. Chinese EVs are putting pressure on other Asian automakers Probably except for Hyundai as their EVs are pretty damn impressive.
"I don‚Äôt think people realize that Honda is not the absolute giant they used to be. In Japan domestically they have lost a significant share of the automotive market. In the US, they only sell 1 car that‚Äôs actually made in Japan as far as I can tell . Certain models have also had some bad reliability issues as well."
"Designs, branding, technology, market share and consumer sentiment. Also global markets. I‚Äôd point specifically to Europe as a place Honda will now better be able to access and compete"
"In 1997, Bill Gates saved Apple from bankruptcy with $150 million for 7% of the company. 4 years later Apple debuted the iPod, 6 years after that they came out with the iPhone. 

Fast forward to today, and that 7% stake is now valued at a staggering $242 billion."
The Japanese government is shoving Nissan down Honda‚Äôs throat.
"Articles always say ‚Äúmerge‚Äù, but one company is always buying the other. We‚Äôve known Nissan was struggling, but it does have value. It seems that Honda thought the price was right."
"Yep, this is fine as long as it's not a McDonnell Douglas and Boeing merger where the larger company gets taken over by the smaller."
Everyone i have ever known that had a Nissan also needed a ride to get it inspected.
"I've always loved Hondas, but my 12 year old Leaf is the best car I have ever owned. Honda needs to step up their EV game."
"Was just about to say

It's either the greatest thing to happen to Nissan since Godzilla or the worst thing to happen to Honda since ever"
"Looking a lot like a Boeing-McDonell Douglas scenario. 

Failing, older, outdated brand that refuses to make fundamental changes in the name of cost cutting that merges with a more successful one. 

Then again, Honda has seen better days as well."
I'm just glad Toyota isn't involved.
"Honda reliability has been going down for the last decade or so. Once they started going towards a more sporty aesthetic, it stopped being as consistent. 

Still good cars, but not the gold standard anymore"
"I can see them lining the brands as follows:

Nissan will be the cheap entry-level brand (like Saturn used to be for GM). Infiniti will be the sporty/sports-luxury brand (think Buick, Pontiac, or Oldsmobile). Honda will the ‚Äúbase‚Äù, workaday brand (like Chevrolet is now for GM). And Acura will be the flagship/luxury brand (like Cadillac)."
"Glad I just bought my 2025 Honda CR-V Sport Hybrid. I buy a new car about every 10 years, so I'll have plenty of time to weather this along with the ""cars and their parts are now impacted by tariffs"" period."
This is also crazy to me as Nissan was just getting ready for their big 40 year anniversary for Nismo. I really hope this might get Nissan to bring back the Pulsar as they will have the ‚Äúsister‚Äù Civic now.
Is Nissan considered bad?¬† I've had a versa for years now and it's been a great little car for me.
"Agreed. I've owned 2 Nissans and traded them quickly because of mechanical / design issues.

I've had one Honda, put almost 300k miles on it and still sold it for a decent amount of cash."
Because less competition always results in better quality
"Hopefully they do for Nissan what Hyundai helped do with KIA. 

I remember when Hyundai and KIA's were piles of shit. Now they are built better then by fucking Audi......"
"I honestly don't get this take, ive essentially ONLY owned Nissans as a Z enthusiast and do all of my own maintenance. The only time I ever had a major mechanical issue was with my 2009 G35 where I had to replace my water pump and that's literally it. 


Any other maintenance has been oil changes, brake pads, etc

Meanwhile on my wife's Subaru, Toyota Camry, AND Ford Focus ive had to replace alternators, coil packs, tensioners, you name it."
"This will be like Microsoft ""merging"" with another company.

This is not about saving Nissan. They are only legally calling it a merger to avoid having the acquisition stopped for monopoly reasons.

At first they will use them for tax breaks, then they will start selling off Nissan's properties and moving staff around. Then comes the management restructure, where a lot of managers will be fired or laid off.

Next they'll start closing dealerships and voiding warranties. After that they'll lay off most of the rest of the staff. Executives will get golden parachutes. In some countries, manufacturers are required to continue producing parts for vehicles for X years after the sale, so they'll outsource manufacturing to sweat shops.

The final phase will be eliminating any remaining staff and auctioning off the company's tool and die inventory.

Honda will then spin off another company and put Honda under it as a subsidiary. Then they'll use the shell company to continue buying up other brands. Next will likely be Hyundai and Kia."
"Both companies are on the way down. Neither have an answer to China‚Äôs thriving EVs or have any EVs that anyone wants to buy. (I‚Äôm talking about the world market not US). The Japanese auto companies bet on hydrogen which is a loser and not one of them has a decent EV that anyone wants to buy. Chinese automakers are going to own the world auto industry soon, Japanese automakers are going to get the scraps. VW is in the same place and will be a shell of the company it is now."
"Expensive... Just say expensive.

Side note Nissan engines are GOAT. Transmissions? I dunno."
I think Nissans are all going to get Honda engines.
"its honda taking the reigns here, Nissan was in trouble, but not enough trouble to outright 'sell'"
Let Nisan take over the electric car focus and ditch their gas engines/transmissions/etc while bringing in Honda level quality control and tolerances? That'd be my play.
Or both!
Only true of the CVTs. Their normal trannys are bulletproof.
Their frontiers are still made without cvts and are very reliable.
Heh. Weak link
"God, Honda, please don't retain shit about Nissan's principles. They lost those about 20 some years back"
Subaru is becoming more dependent on its partnership with Toyota.¬†
"Honestly didn't even realize Subaru was japanese until recently. Japan really knows how to build a car, too bad not all are being built in japan though."
Everything will be owned by two major brands. Perfect for price fixing.¬†
"If they didn't, Nissan would disappear. They're so far behind on EV/battery tech, it's crazy."
"Eh, all these auto companies are losing mkt share and auto manufacturing is a scale game. EVs require massive investments (doubling capital intensity) in a world where the auto sales is not increasing. 

If they don‚Äôt merge, they will die. Chinese EV OEMs and Tesla are the new competition. They‚Äôve taken massive share of the export market and will keep taking share bc of EVs"
Less so for auto manufacturers. There are too many for what the market can support long term.
I've heard from industry insiders that the Japanese govt is basically forcing Honda's hand here.
"But were you not concerned when Big Tobacco bought out every single major food company in the US and turned their thousands of scientists on how to make food more addicting ?

So Infiniti just vanishes?
A full size truck with Honda reliability could be a good thing.
Kia and Hyundai are competitors

The Japanese government is pushing for this merger. Nissan is dying and they don‚Äôt want to bail them out.
I believe the combined Honda/Nissan automaker will still have fewer domestic car sales in Japan than Toyota.
"Japan handles things differently than we do here.  They are much more collaborative.  Banks, corporations, and the government all work together to protect smaller or struggling companies.  Toyota recently partnered with Mazda on R&D and are sharing factories.  Mazda is a competitor to Toyota, but Japanese companies work together to strengthen their overall business."
"Japan rolls failing companies together and gets them a bailout if needed.

All of Japans LCD companies were merged into JDI (Hitachi, Sony and Toshiba) and bailed out with public money in 2011 for example.

Honda is doing okay but may get some support on finances.

Toshiba semiconductor (not Kioxia the NAND part) was put into a roll-up with money from Rohm recently too."
Anti trust laws aren‚Äôt designed to prevent one company from basically rescuing another via a merger.
"I feel your pain, I have a 2013 Sentra with a transmission that‚Äôs been replaced so many times that the next one‚Äôs free."
Honda is doing this to absorb Nissan‚Äôs technology. Their transmissions are effectively a thing of the past now.
Renault has been trying to weasel out of this for years but they don't have the cash. Once Renault is freed from their ability to design drivetrains dark days are ahead. I can't even find speculation on how Mitsubishi fits into this.
Shut up i want that VTEC Versa
"My 2018 Civic still feels brand new transmission and engine both smooth and precise, even thou I was kinda afraid that would not be the case of newer ones."
They don't have to redo their transmissions every 3 years?
Already here.
I love the competitive prices and improved quality for consumers that result from every merger.   /s
Sounds like Nissan wasn‚Äôt a power at all¬†
"Honda Nissan or Nissan Honda can also happen, same as Square Enix, Bandai Namco, or KoeiTecmo."
"Well, both hondissan.com and nishonda.com are taken. We're in for another David vs. Goliath domain name battle."

Nothing? Bigger impact on Renault unless the RNA + Mitsubishi partnership dissolved with hearing about.
"Mazda has some kind of partnership with Toyota. It began (i think?) with the Scion iA which was a rebadged Mazda2 sedan which just so happens to be the first car I ever had. They opened a factory together in Alabama that produces the Corolla Cross, CX50, CX30, and CX90. I forget what else Toyota makes in that plant. Toyota invested a 5% stake in Mazda a few years ago, too. If anything, Toyota will either try to buy Mazda or own a large chunk of the company like they do for Subaru's parent company. One day, Toyota will just own all Japanese car brands. Japan will be renamed Toyota Land in the near future, and every vehicle on Toyotan roads will be Landcruisers."
They will merge with Ahura Motors to form Ahura-Mazda.
"If we take a little step back, HonDatsun?"

Not all mergers are bad. Take Honda and Nissan for example. There could be some really cool things that come out of them merging. First off they‚Äôve got a ton of resources and smart people together. That means they can make some seriously advanced cars that are way better than anything else on the road. They can save money by combining their operations. That means you might get cheaper cars in the future. And they‚Äôll be stronger in the market so they can beat out other car companies and stay afloat even when the economy goes down. Oh and they can do more research and development. That means they can make cars that are better for the environment. That‚Äôs important because people are getting more and more concerned about the environment.
"Nissan was fantastic until French Renault bought a piece of the pie. 

Hopefully this merger means they own less relatively."
"My buddy put 250,000kms on his 04 on the same timing belt. 

I'm sure it went further, because he sold it to a friend when he moved away."
"Because Nissan sadly devolved into a trash company. But Nissan management doesn‚Äôt have to have an influence on the Honda‚Äôs decisions to screw things up. Honda still has to absorb Nissan‚Äôs facilities, teams, and processes."
Yeah Honda gets trucks and ev tech from Nissan
She said I don't believe you. I said it's fuckin' true!
If you‚Äôre looking for a ride! I‚Äôve a horse outside!
Fck you‚Äôve just unlocked a core memory for me.
"As a former Leaf owner, I don't think Nissan's EV space is all that shit hot. Better than Honda's maybe but that's not saying much of anything.

As a former Nissan owner, when they partnered up with Renault, Renault build quality got marginally better while Nissan's design department started smoking the houseplants. 

And now I own a BMW and a BYD. Life is better.

So long as Honda's motorcycle operations remain firewalled off from the automotive, these two can do whatever dirty dancing they want."
That was just 5 years ago
"Same, but 2002"
"Okay, so I‚Äôm not the only one that thinks their paint is ass. I absolutely love my Accord, but the paint hasn‚Äôt held up well and the windshield has more micro scratches than any car I‚Äôve ever been in."
I always say honda is an engine company that just so happens to make cars so this fits
I solved the paint and rust problem by not living where the weather is shite.
"This is exactly the reason I will not buy another Honda.  Great mechanicals and handling, but paper thin sheet metal that dings and rusts easily, and easily damaged paint."
I'm hoping this will lead to a convertible Infiniti based on the GT-R.
Trucks and EV tech.
"Nissan was the first automaker to manufacture a consumer scale and consumer priced EV in the form of the Nissan Leaf.

Surely there must be something in there of value."
The Leaf was in North America. It didn't sell. My friend had one.
Well I do get you on the truck thing.  I'm a big Honda fan but the Ridgeline is not my idea of a truck :)  The Frontier and Titan are not particularly reliable trucks but maybe Honda can fix that.
This is correct.  Honda was forced to license a bunch of GM EV patents and struck a deal to sell a rebadged Chevy Blazer as a Prologue because they were so far behind in this area.  Nissan has the potential to provide a lot of know-how related to EVs.  Honda somehow dragged their feet on the EV front more than Toyota and now they are paying for it.
"At least in SEA, Nissan's new vehicles all use a full series hybrid (ePower). So unlike the other main hybrids on the road the engine is not mechanically coupled to the wheels at all. You lose some highway efficiency this way (since you can't do low RPM engine at high road speed), but the advantage is that the motors and inverters are fully sized for the required acceleration already, so converting the architecture to pure EV is as simple as mounting a (bigger) battery and charger."
"  China is destroying Honda (and almost all of the Japanese automakers)  in much of Southeast Asia too

For example, BYD M6 is eating Avanza/Mobilio market share and Seal  is trashing Camry/Civic as we speak"
"I feel like the price of a Godzilla on the market right now is about to double. RIP, big guy."
"And in Boeings case, they kept the Boeing name, but took on the failing, cost-cutting strategy of McConnell Douglas, and quality at the merged Boeing took a huge nosedive. Let‚Äôs hope Hondas won‚Äôt start being built like Nissans."
"Honda still makes excellent engines but they went the granny route on design and fell out of interest with younger demographics. 

Meanwhile, Nissan revitalized their brand while focusing on cool new designs. 

If they focus on each brand‚Äôs strengths as they combine, it could turn out great. I‚Äôve really wanted to buy another Honda engine but they haven‚Äôt made a decent design, IMO since the S2000 years."
"And in recent memory like dollar tree and family dollar.

Dollar Tree was the better business now they are slowly turning it into family dollar.¬†"
I‚Äôve heard some not good things about Toyota reliability recently.¬†
One of my worst mistakes was buying a Toyota. Never again.
"It's probably more of Honda ""buys"" Nissan but marketed as an equal ""50/50 merge"". Honda is definitely much bigger, with motorcycles and generator products (and maybe some others). I doubt Nissan would have much say on Honda's business decision."
What brand should I be looking at for a reliable car?
"The car development cycle is 5 years. So depending when they finish the merger and changes actually take effect, they may design exactly one car with the new joint leadership, just in time for you to buy it. 

Let us know how it goes."
Yep. Just got an HRV I'm very happy with. Have 10 years or so to ride this out.¬†
They have massive issues with their CV transmissions.  I've also heard bad things about the Titan/Armada.
"Ya, their reputation is trash now, especially compared to the 90s and early 2000s. Like any make, they'll have a few good models in upper trims, but their base models are trash relative to what other makes offer."
"Toyota was and will still be the biggest competition. Nissan has been in a pretty significant downfall. With the exception of the incredibly overpriced Z, there's really nothing too noteworthy from them. I would have suspected them to just be a forgotten brand like Mitsubishi in the next decade or so if not for this."
It's a better result then Nissan being bought out by Tencent.. car subscriptions anyone ?
Quality is Job #1.
"This. Even if Honda isn‚Äôt poisoned by its food, this is still some pretty heavy market consolidation. Unfortunately, Nissan was going to die anyway."
You might have just had a string of good/bad luck. I have a 2013 Sentra that‚Äôs had its transmission replaced so many times that the next one‚Äôs free.
"> Next will likely be Hyundai and Kia

Those are Korean brands and are already part of the same chaebol (Hyundai). There's no way in hell the South Korean government lets Hyundai be bought up by a Japanese company. They'd allow a sale to an American company long before they'd allow a sale to a Japanese company, and they definitely wouldn't allow a sale to American company unless the country's economy was in a decades long freefall."
what's stopping toyota or vw from simply acquiring or licensing tech from one of the many companies out there? And what's stopping those chinese companies from making growth outside of china at this moment? Which of these do you think is more difficult to solve? How long do you think it will take for them to solve those problems? How long before EVs become the dominant global market force?¬†
Yeah the 5.6‚Äôs are great engines‚Ä¶ until debris from the catalytic converter gets sucked in and destroys it.
"I had to replace 3 in my 300zx, 1 in a Stanza. I solved the 300zx problem by finally putting in a T5 from a turbo model."
Right around when French Renault bought a piece of the pie.
Toyota owns at least 20% of Subaru. Tbh I won't be surprised if they fully absorb Subaru or the two completely merge in short order (especially with this Honda Nissan news).
Call it Hondasan to comply with Japanese language.
Two? We‚Äôre moving towards CHOAM level of monopoly faster than I thought we would.
Companies are allowed to disappear
"I get it, and it's a shame for Nissan, but I'm less concerned about the wellbeing of corporations than I am for the ever-shrinking options of the average person. 

The common adage of ""If you don't like it, don't buy it"" gets more difficult with every merger."
"Yes, that is also concerning?

Not sure your point here."
They basically have already. Look at their lineup right now.
Yes‚Ä¶.it was already reported that was happening.
It should¬†
Nissan stopped building full sized trucks
Owned both by Hyundai
"Versa drivers are actively suicidal, also reflected in their driving"
Ah makes sense. Read something about Nissan's issues a few days back. Thanks.
Why can't they just fail? Why would Japan have to bail them out?
"I can see it being a case of ‚Äúworking together to combat against foreign aggression.‚Äù¬†¬†They likely don‚Äôt have large, natural resources compared to other countries (land, money [?], workforce). They probably don‚Äôt want other countries buying out Japanese companies if, and when, they go under. If it happens too often, they will lose their global position in the market.¬†"
"Anyone could dive deeper into the keiretsu system that spawned off of the broken up zaibatsu. Every major company has shares and is in alliance with every other major companies. The backbone of the system, the major banks, also all financed every other major company. It's an entangled web that all very entrenched and you can contrast it to whatever the chaebol is doing to Korea."
Toyota also has a stake in Subaru. They're much more collaborative in Japan than the US.
Had a Versa I think 2013 too
Shit's been kinda wild ever since the Carlos Ghosn coup
Still driving my 2014 Civic coupe. Kept up with the maintenance and its running as good as ever.
We have a bingo
"Eh, fantastic might be a bit of an overstatement. They were competitive/fine, if unexciting. Post Renault they are now unappealing and unreliable."
I've got an Avalon with 203k miles on the og timing belt. I know I'm on borrowed time. Haven't found time to replace it yet.
"that's only like 150,000 miles. 

no offense, but that's usually the mileage i buy cars at. my 05 Cadillac Escalade is currently at 465,000 miles on the original timing chain. when i bought it, it had 160,000 miles on it."
"It's a merger, not an acquisition."
I swapped him for a bag of yokes in 1992
"I think the whole point is to take what they've gotten for EVs and trucks & translate it over into Honda products. Honda just only started introducing hybrids in the last couple of years while it's been around in the public for a bit. Acura has I think only 1 fully electric vehicle in the ZDX currently. 

Obviously I don't think they'd ever take Nissans CVTs as it's been pretty much a reputation killer for them since the 2010s but I don't think Honda is going to combine with them or let them be without giving them some sort of compensation whether it be their EV knowledge or trucks."
Yeah 2020.. still a very young Honda lmao. My 2006 is going strong as the day it was bought. (No paint issues either surprisingly)
"I think most Japanese cars have had paint issues. With that said I can drive around with a bad paint job, can‚Äôt drive around if the car breaks down. Coughs in jeep."
Are you aware that paint protection films and underbody coating exist for people who drive in regions with extreme weather?
My Honda‚Äôs paint literally blew off in a hurricane.
I saw a guy running from the police in an Altima he stole from the dealership but after a few miles they called it off. They approved his credit application and dropped the charges.¬†
"> Trucks

Ding ding ding. Honda has wanting to get in on that for years."
Maybe 10-12 years ago.
"The Frontier since the platform refresh and facelift is great for what it is. Too big for what it should be, but I miss mine after spending the last year in a Tacoma."
Didn't they gamble on fuel cells being the energy of the future?
"In that case it came down to who they picked to run the company.   Boeing's CEO were traditionally engineers who's main priority was quality and innovation.

After the McDonnell Douglas merger the CEO was an accountant who immediately began to impose cost cutting measures and focus on share price.

He was replaced by an engineer...who had an MBA who basically stayed focus on the same thing but was a mirage to appease the public.

Boeing quality just went from bad to worse, with the 737 crashings problem, doors and panels flying off, and Airbus eating away huge chunks of the market share."
"The article says Honda management will initially lead, with the 2 companies (3 if Mitsubishi joins) carrying on largely as they are. The merger is largely to pool resources for their EVs to have a Japanese brand keep up with competition."
Ok hear me out .. 370Z powered S2000 and GTR powered NSX
"I dunno, their new designs are all pretty good. Accord, civic, passport, pilot, crv all pretty good looking and competitive in their class. They don‚Äôt have a shit box anymore (RIP Fit) but maybe that‚Äôs where Nissan comes in"
There is nothing appealing about Nissans lol. Some of the ugliest things on the road
Idk the new civic design is pretty great and they went and put the modern electronics package inside for still a great price.
"I think Honda learned something going into the 2020‚Äôs, the styling on new Hondas is pretty great on all the current models. The new passport is really good looking and the Civic I just bought looks great as well."
The K-series engines are super reliable.
"Nissan designs are hideous, hondas look decent"
The new Accord is a snooze fest
"I want a prelude that won't be some stupid hybrid.  Give me a turbo i4, and 4 wheel steering."
"The new Lexus sedan models are very uninspiring, and the new Camrys don't seem to have any interior styling of note."
"The Tundra and associated platforms have had some problems, but the platform used in the Prius, RAV4, ECT, are basically some of the best on the road."
"I feel like you can generally find someone who has that experience with any given car brand, no matter how well regarded it may be. The inverse as well. 

Does make things a bit confusing."
The NPR story about it seemed to imply that the Japanese government is pushing it to keep Nissan from being bought by a foreign company.¬†
"Honda‚Äôs small engines (generators, lawnmowers, snowblowers, etc) are the gold standard. I hope they keep that intact."
"Generally speaking, Toyota and Lexus are the best.

Honda, Buick, and Subaru are good brands. 

Ford, Chevy, and Hyundai are cheap. They're going to have problems, but they are good for the price.

Don't buy Jeep or Dodge.

Don't know much about electric cars. I do know most have terrible quality assurance. 

Remember: Any car can have problems. If you take care of a car, it'll last longer. Get any used car checked out at a trusted repair place before purchase"
"I was told up front I had to have my transmission serviced every 25k miles, but I haven't had any issues with it otherwise."
"I guess, but that would be an insane string of luck considering my first nissan was a 1989 TT Z. That's quite the stretch of time."
"surprising but i dont know much about that generation. i'm only familiar with the mid 2000s+. i know of a frontier, a 350z, my own r52 pathfinder and a titan*all with 150-200k miles on them with zero engine or trans issues"
"Hmm, imagine a subaru with a reliable i4 engine.  That may finally be one worth owning as someone who works on their own vehicles and does not wish to revisit the frustrations of an h4."
Nissan is disappearing. Into Honda.
Isn't acquisition one way for them to disappear?
They disappear by getting bought out
The amount of options would equally shrink even if Nissan wasn‚Äôt bought. You can‚Äôt buy cars from a bankrupt and dissolved company either.
So should Chrysler.
"Don't they have one?
https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/trucks/titan.html"
"No, Hyundai made an investment in Kia, like Microsoft made an investment in Apple. Both times to keep competition afloat.¬†"
Because they‚Äôre a major employer and Japan needs to protect its auto industry.
"The Keiretsu system is actually disappearing and in some cases completely gone in certain companies. Japan has come a long way to focusing on shareholder value. Many banks like MUFG have sold off stakes in loan customers and as a result, increased share value. 

It's not all the same but the system is changing. The auto industry in Japan is fragmented. If you think about it, The US has 3 majors,  Korea has 1. France has 2. Japan has effectively 6 manufacturers. So much capital has to spread to make this work. With cheap Chinese competition with early lead In EVs, it only makes sense that some of Japan's players might struggle."
No wonder Toyota is extremely successful.
"Just looked it up and Renault bought a big piece of Nissan in 1999. You'd be right Nissan/Infiniti were fine in the 90's, but both Nissan and Infiniti were absolutely rocking a few years when they hit it out of the park with the VQ series engine. The Altima, G35, and later the Q35 absolutely killed it for a while with the VQ35 which was powerful and reliable. 

What did them in was putting a CVT in the Altima and the Murano with the big V6 in 2007 IIRC. Really killed their ""just as reliable but more fun"" image."
"Calling pre Renault Nissan unexciting is comical, some of the best sports cars ever made came from Nissan between 1970-2000."
"We just had to replace ours 170k 15 civic, mechanic said ours was holding on by a thread."
didn't Boeing's quality go off a cliff starting not long after they merged with somebody
"It's an acquisition structure as a merger, which is fairly common with companies this large.  It helps with various tax shit as well as maintaining existing contracts."
It's *always* an acquisition
"The distinction isn‚Äôt as strong as you think. Mergers aren‚Äôt usually 50/50. One side usually has a stronger say in the formation of the new company. In this case, that‚Äôs Honda (because Honda has the stronger position)."
"Umm the Honda Insight was introduced 25 years ago so I don‚Äôt know that counts as ‚Äòlast couple of years‚Äô

Even the Prius is like 27 years old. 

The Nissan Leaf debut was in 2010. 

All three of these companies had early new-market momentum but for some reason decided to take a nap. And now Honda (among others like Toyota) are following their dicks into the hydrogen quicksand. 

Point is, unless Nissan has some ultra-secret EV skunkworks, this merger is driven by money, not product or tech."
"Yep. My mom still drives my old 03 Accord.  2020 is a relatively ""new"" car for any automaker."
"First thing I did buying an MX-5 was to get it rust-proofed, they're notorious for thin paint and inadequate underseal"
"For my job I sometimes have to drive my bosses car. I‚Äôd rather not, because it‚Äôs a jeep. I hate it. It drives like shit."
Yes Subarus have terrible paint too
"That's a hell of an assumption.  I live in the GTA and I don't drive in extreme weather.  The finish gets scratched and nicked very easily as compared to other cars I've owned (VW, Audi, Subaru).  I get it though - fanboys worship at the temple of Honda."
Takes a second but ‚Ä¶ nicely done! ü§£
Fingers crossed. Honda engine in a compact pickup would be *Jeff‚Äôs Kiss*
They may have had some good things in R&D. Nissan isn‚Äôt known for bad R&D. It‚Äôs known for bad follow through.
What did you prefer about the Frontier over the Tacoma?
"An accountant or MBA is guaranteed to know the price of everything, but they aren‚Äôt guaranteed to know the value of anything."
"They chose because of the incentive structure. Short-term profits are favored over long-term growth. Shareholders want to see that price spike

From there it‚Äôs an easy decision. Produce the shit product under the name with built up good will."
"Yup.  We bought a CRV a couple of years ago and this things is the tits.  It's slick-looking as hell, and the engine is easy to maintain and doesn't fall apart.

We owned two new GM vehicles before that and by this point they had constant failures.  Honda just makes a great, long-lasting product.

I had a 2002 Civic and would you believe that fucker is still running around in my old hometown for the person who bought it from my mom (who I sold it to when I moved)?"
"The new civics are wider and bulker than the last two sportier generations. They drive and look like my mom's sedan in the 80s. It broke my heart, I wanted a new civic to replace my 2010 SO MUCH and just hated driving the new ones. It was like driving your mom's car.¬†


I feel like moving away from sporty was a mistake. No one who wants a family vehicle buys a sedan anymore, focus on the demographic buying cars.¬†"
Ridgeline is a phenomenal vehicle.
The new accord is atrocious if we‚Äôre being honest here.
"I don't like their designs, but they're quite recognizable.  There's merit to at least trying to be unique."
"They're marketing toward a younger, niche demographic lately though and it's... kind of working. Think Scion of the 2000s. People had the same complaint back then"
"Some of them look alright, though I suspect they won't age as gracefully as some of their previous models. The issue that I have with Nissan is their lack of QC, reliability, and failure to keep up with the rest of the market."
Yeah I'm glad I got one before the most recent redesigns. My 2020 Accord Hybrid is the most enjoyable car I've ever owned.
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted. I had a 16 V6 and that was my favorite car ever. Now all you get is a 1.8 turbo I think? They took the fun out of the car.
I had the 2.2 vtec 4ws prelude. Awesome machine in its day. Wouldn't look dated even now.
Toyotas have always had the interior of a dodge panel van.
Lexus sedans have never been ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù. They let the Germans take the risk of being cutting edge. You buy a Lexus bc of its reliability and comfort.
"I couldn't disagree more. 

The new Land Cruiser/Lexus models are looking very good. They are new designs, so there are surely kinks to be worked out in the first year models, but that's true of any manufacturer or model of vehicle. And their look and style are very current, rugged, and catchy. 

I cannot speak to the Camrys. I don;t drive those, I'm a 4Runner guy. My 4Runner is robust and amazing. If it wasn't for a tornado bringing a tree down on my old one, I'd still be driving it. They apparently last forever."
"The new 4Runner is over masculine on the inside, same with the Tacoma. Not to mention pricing being absolutely insane. I really like the external styling is nice but the interior is trash to me.¬†"
"To be honest, I probably don‚Äôt have enough knowledge to comment on it. I‚Äôve just heard they aren‚Äôt as reliable so thank you for the clarification.¬†"
"(Engine destroys self in 4000 miles) ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs having some problems, but other than that she‚Äôs cherry!‚Äù"
"Haha, Buick is just a dressed-up chevy.  I'd definitely not consider them more reliable, definitely a step down with all the added complexity and electronics.  Domestic cars don't rank any better than Nissan, most at or below Nissan level.

Also, just from a serviceability level, I'd go i4 over h4 every day of the week.  And even if you aren't working on it yourself, you'll notice the price difference at the mechanic.  Honda is still more reliable than Subaru in that aspect, because they don't tend to overcomplicate stuff."
"It's very specific to models released in the late 2000s and 2010s and specifically the cars the masses buy like the Altima and the Versa and their crossovers.

That you had a G35 indicates you're more buying the higher end vehicles at this point."
"True, but a gap in the market would encourage competition from the remaining manufacturers, instead of just one manufacturer increasing their market share."
"Discontinued now, 2024 was the last model year"

"I own a g37 with the VQ37VHR. I am well aware of the VQ. The problem is a single success doesn‚Äôt move the needle much. Their styling, transmissions, and tech was still bad. If they could have kept that momentum, they could have become something competitive.

While some of their cars found some enthusiast love, the general public only bought the cheap, eco-boxes with little profit margin. All their upmarket options were either unreliable, not compelling or were a bad value pound for pound, sometimes all of the above. As an Infiniti owner, the brand was the budget option in the luxury market, yet you could get a well spaced Mazda with 95% of what an Infiniti offered for much less. Heck even the titanium trim Ford models are kinda competitive with Infiniti and that‚Äôs just kinda sad."
"I agree with you, but you and I come with a bias. I also love especially the 80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs Z cars. The unfortunate thing is great sports cars are the minority of what a car brand sells. They can‚Äôt single-handedly prop up a brand.

Especially around the early to mid 90‚Äôs, the Nissans that appealed to most people, that made up the majority of their sales, were unexciting. They were small, underpowered, exceptionally average reliability, and cheap. They weren‚Äôt pushing the envelope like the Americans were doing in the SUV space with the Bronco or Explorer; or Toyota and Honda were doing were doing with legendary reliability. They also weren‚Äôt as cheap as the Hyundai‚Äôs or Isuzu‚Äôs to target the budget market.¬†

They just really didn‚Äôt have a niche and saw their market share start to erode even before Renault bought them out and accelerated that process."
"Yes, because paradoxically though MD got merged into Boeing, MD‚Äôs management team somehow took control of Boeing."
"yes, after the McDonnell Douglas merger in the late 90s"
"Both brands (possibly including Mitsubishi) are going to be wholly owned subsidiaries.  It's not an acquisition.   There will be a parent company.  

It's a merger, by definition."
"The GTA is somewhere in the salt belt. You should get the underbody coatings at minimum for your area, or cars already prone to rusting will rust early on you. I speak from experience as someone from Minnesota and seeing the effects road salt induced rust has on all sorts of vehicles here."
You don't have to be a fanboy to prioritize reliability over finishing
One other than the ridgeline that is
Nissan of the 90s and 2000s was pretty legit they have definitely fallen off
More upright seating posture was more comfortable for long drives. Engine was much more responsive and MPG didn‚Äôt take a huge nosedive in the cold or above 2500 RPM. Mostly just personal preference though.
I sold my 2 door accord 8 years ago with 180k on it when I had a child and needed an upgrade. I still see the new owner using it as their daily drive.
"I had a 2002 Civic EX auto, The model with the lousy transmission. I know because I put two replacements in it and sold it at 111k miles/11 years when transmission #3 started showing signs of failure."
"Just sold my 2012 Honda Crosstour.  Only had to do maintenance, no problems whatsoever.  I loved it.  I will miss it.  And 18 year old is getting it as his first car and he and I are both happy."
"You're not wrong, the 11th gen refresh is a huge step back from the 10th gen Accord design. They applied the previous styling to the Civic sedan and hatchback and they're both stellar looking.¬†"
"you pay for the reliability.

the interior is extra"
I tell my wife that her RX is a couch on wheels. Not fun to drive at all. But it is comfy.
"The late 90's and early 2000's were iconic for the Camry and by extension, the Lexus sedan."
The recent engine fiasco is a shitshow extraordinaire.
I'm a 5 star man. A *golden* god. Range rover or bust.
"As someone who owns a 23 4Runner, I think the look of the 4R and Tacoma are fine, I just hate the prices. That‚Äôs it. Taco had some issues but those appear to be being ironed out. 1st new gen always happens that way"
You‚Äôd just have another big company fill the gap if it was profitable. It wouldn‚Äôt increase your options at all¬†
"that's like a major no-no in regards to a merger. 

you're doing the merger to save a company from going under. it's best not to let the same group that ran that company into the ground, then be in charge after the merger. 

as a matter of fact, that particular group of people should be the very first made 'redundant' and let go."
"Honda, which has a market capitalisation of more than $40 billion, roughly four times that of Nissan, will appoint the majority of the company's board, they said.  [source](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/honda-nissan-set-announce-launch-integration-talks-media-reports-say-2024-12-22/)"
"where would you get this done at? I‚Äôm in your neighbor state (hi from south dakota) and travel all over for work (IA, NE, MN, WI) and my 09 civic really started to rust bottom up. i‚Äôve got a ‚Äò22 civic hatch now and wanna prevent that from happening. can you get the coating at the dealership or? 

i didn‚Äôt know this was a thing, thought i just needed to wash my car frequently enough to rid it of salt. i‚Äôll definitely look into it!!"
"That's another area where Honda is overrated.  Reliability is the reason my next car will be a Toyota, or another Subaru."
"The Ridgeline is (barely) a full-size pickup, it‚Äôs just a unibody, which is why everyone gives it shit."
"Yeah, I think my civic had something like 200k on it when I sold it, and that was 12, almost 13, years ago.  God knows how many miles that thing has racked up on it now."
That's the model I had.  I hadn't heard about the transmission issues.  I drove mine for over a decade before I sold it and never had any issues at all (that weren't self-inflicted anyway).
The new US Land Cruiser is the Land Cruiser Prado that the rest of the world gets. You can still get the 300 series in the form of the LX600
There's an ancient Arabic saying. If you want to go to the desert. You take a range rover or land rover. If you want to come back. You take a land cruiser.
"I‚Äôm happy you like the 2025 models, I do not, I think it is too angular. Aside from price, that is why I wouldn‚Äôt buy one. I just don‚Äôt like the interior.¬†"
Plus people are keeping their jobs with this merger
"McDonnell Douglas negotiated to keep their execs onboard after the merger, and then before the merger closed they promoted all their senior management to executives, so they outnumbered Boeing‚Äôs execs."
Call around to shops and ask if they do fluid film.  Definitely don't go to the dealership and get charged out the wahzoo for something anyone with a lift and an air gun can do.  Make sure they have the long applicator cable that can snake inside gaps and holes to fill spaces that can collect debris.
It's as /u/bulkypage says.
Yeah I like the Ridgeline for most people but most people want a giant truck. I‚Äôd like to see Honda do a full size truck with 4 wheel drive. This Nissan merger could help them do that with their larger engines.
"The EX is slightly more powerful with the same transmission. Anecdotally, I still see a decent number of 2001-2005 Civics here, but very few EX anymore. When they were new cars, probably half of them were EX around here."
"It was a quote from ""it's always sunny in Philadelphia""

I drive a civic, camry, and mini cooper lol"
"Ridgeline is giant for what most people who want a truck really need. Because of the EPA incentives and the Chicken Tax on imports, even the Ranger, Frontier, Tacoma and GM offerings are enormous compared to the knockabout compact pickups of the 70s through early 2000s.

I just want a 90s Toyota extended-cab pickup with modern safety features and amenities."
Yeah I drive by a mid 80s dodge dakota every day that I‚Äôd love to have. It‚Äôs so small.
Suchir's paper on Fair Use and AI: [https://suchir.net/fair\_use.html](https://suchir.net/fair_use.html)
I feel like things haven't ended well for a lot of whistleblowers these days.
why don‚Äôt we investigate his death as much as the ceo?
">Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.

This concerns me too! Google's ""AI Overview"" as the first search result is the worst idea they've ever had. On more than a few occasions, I've found the AI Overview results are dead wrong. 

But most fools are lazy and won't go past that first answer."
"One brilliant way to get rid of somebody that your corporation does not like is to start a stalking / harassment campaign that drives them to suicide, keeping your hands clean. This is exactly what was done to the Boeing whistleblower over decades before he died, and it is well documented. There was a big story about top execs at eBay doing this to a publisher that was critical of them and they only got slaps on the wrist."
The majority of them appear to have been totally inconspicuous mentally unstable. It is remarkable how easily and quickly causes of death are determined and accepted in the environment of corrupt companies. And this is happening worldwide!
So much as we'd like to blame putin killing off his opposition. Were doing the same it seems. And just like putin. The news does not really cover these things.
Note to self : stay away from whistles
can someone summarise what he actually said against the company?
"Aaaand, ya wonder why people cheer why a CEO gets shot. The blatant criminality of the white collar rich against the ‚Äòcan‚Äôt fight back‚Äô class‚Ä¶I believe they call this ‚Äòblowback‚Äô"
It's so weird how whistleblowers seem to have such a conveniently high mortality rate
"OpenAI is taking the Boeing route, it appears."
"Anyone that says ""Hey maybe they just died or maybe they committed suicide because of the pressure they were under and the realization that they will unfortunately be blacklisted in their chosen field forever?"" gets downvoted to oblivion 

This must be what Republicans who aren't batshit fucking insane conspiracy theorists feel like every day."
Things do not ever go well for whistleblowers when it‚Äôs over. You‚Äôre basically deciding that ‚Äútrying‚Äù to hold a company accountable for whatever the thing is outweighs you ever being hirable again in your field.  Maybe if it‚Äôs a massive case you can get a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù book deal out of it but that‚Äôs likely all. Once you settle in at home alone with zero companies who will talk to you after googling your name I imagine the prospect of ending it all becomes painfully more real.
"A company kills a random person & no one bats an eye, A random person kills a CEO and everyone loses their damn minds."
"Gee, there sure are a lot of downvotes on a lot of really normal-seeming comments on this thread. 

I'm sure it's just a coincidence."
CEO are killing people now.
Why aren‚Äôt these whistleblowers put in witness protection?
"He pretty much just said that AI will make all of y'all slaves by copying anything and everything that exists in the marketplace.¬†


And was murdered for it.


Nothing to see here."
Can we have some stats on the number of whistleblowers who end up dead? Chances for survival?  Isn't it time people started demanding that national police agencies go a lot harder on these investigations?
OpenAI seems to be using the same playbook as Boeing.
The AI grift bubble can‚Äôt pop fast enough
Would think the most honest companies would want to have the best health insurance possible so to avoid these cases.
Isn't this headline just describing what a whistleblower is?
We know it was the AI right? Is it self defense of the AI offed him so the AI could survive?
Seems like it‚Äôs a bad time to be a whistleblower and a corrupt CEO
"You take one CEO and news outlets are having a heyday. When it comes to whistleblowers who have information on greedy corporations, news outlets are blowing whistles."
Does Boeing own open AI?
We need a whistle blower protection plan where we surround and guard them with hundreds of civilians until their testimony is on record.
"so which is scarier, the c suite had him killed to protect their business or the ai had him killed to protect itself?"
Nothing to see here then..
‚ÄúWhistleblow? How about whistle-no.‚Äù
"Skynet took him out, all part of the plan."
"Plot twist: It was the new o1-preview AI model that convinced him to commit suicide.

Edited"
"Well, what are the actual consequences so far if companies have been involved in these deaths?"
"There‚Äôs a lot of companies doing shady shit to survive so these whistle blowers would really dampen their parade so they feel they have to resort to any extreme to stay alive at this point even if it means killing innocents out in the open. In their eyes they will most likely get away with it or find someone as a ‚Äúrogue‚Äù escape goat. Where I live there was a doctor that found an extremely successful cancer treatment and was killed by a ‚Äúbad business partner‚Äù and we also have a former Merck employee that was very outspoken against the company that died of ‚Äúnatural causes‚Äù 

Whistle blowers and disrupters have been getting killed for decades, it‚Äôs just that companies are now getting sloppier and the numbers are adding up better. It doesn‚Äôt just look like coincidences now."
If we find out anyone from Boeing is at OpenAI it‚Äôd be more sus
Why would they pay their dogs to investigate themselves?
"I know this is sarcasm, but it's not new. Madoff was prosecuted and sentenced to essentially life in prison, the people responsible for the 2008 economic crisis were not prosecuted at all.

The difference is that Madoff ripped off rich people and the same thing applies here."
"The police are paid to reinforce the wealth gap and protect the rich. The economic system that gives one in 10,000 the vast amount of wealth from the 9,999, is a corrupt system. Thus it follows, if are not part of the corruption, then you are seen as acting against. Then it follows from there, the police are deployed to maintain the corruption, and tasked to shut down any good people or non-rich that would make efforts to upset the extreme levels of inequality that the people on too benefit vastly from."
Are they not investigating it?
"Who says they aren‚Äôt? 

It‚Äôs also pretty easy for the media to make a spectacle when there was so much physical evidence publicly available and the alleged shooter was found. 

Not really a 1:1 here."
"I'm kind of suspicious that they want people to distrust AI because they aren't really a market leader, and most people think ""AI"" is a homogenous mass, as opposed to being aware that there are different AIs, since of which are way more reliable than others. Google's is wrong *all the time*, and they have it front and center. ChatGPT o1 hallucinates far less."
"there is documented declassified evidence that the FBI used those exact tactics on MLK. and that's just what the government is obligated to tell us, private enterprise has no such duty to public transparency. 

fight the power."
There is a great episode on Behind the Bastards on the ebay scandal. The victims had no idea who was harassing them and why. It had to be the most incompetent corporate harassment ever!
I imagine other countries joke about American Whistleblower deaths the way we joke about Russians falling out of windows.
Incredible how you're somehow able to determine someone mental state simply from reading a new article. You should become a detective.
I try to resist conspiracy theories but I find it interesting that OpenAI finalized a major defense department contract 6 days before this dude turned up dead.
Except here our rulers are corporate.
Hypocrisy has become the bread and butter of this generation of leaders unfortunately.
Do they though? I've not seen any evidence that they do or don't.
With this much money involved in the most powerful scientific advancement humanity has ever made anything is possible.
How many whistleblowers have to commit suicide before we consider foul play.
They always have been.
that was the old days before the corruption took over everything
I couldn‚Äôt find any stats but this article addresses this issue [https://www.newsweek.com/death-toll-whistleblowing-must-end-now-opinion-1879325](https://www.newsweek.com/death-toll-whistleblowing-must-end-now-opinion-1879325)
"ChatGPT is a large language model and can't take actions on its own.  If only responds directly to input. If anybody has this guy killed, it was a person (it people) and not a bunch of GPUs."
A strange amount of pro whistleblower death comments here lol
"Nothing, because, much to the dismay of redditors, the companies did not murder them."
Unfortunately can‚Äôt take any of your points seriously since you referred to it as an ‚Äúescape goat‚Äù. lol
"What? AI is just automated copyright infringement on an institutional level. LLMs would not exist without copyright infringement on a massive scale.


Having someone from the inside pointing that out from the witness stand could very well have spelled the end for publicly available AI models. Of course they would fear what this guy had to say."
It could be that he committed suicide because he couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure of having to testify. It reminds me of the Theranos scientist Ian Gibbons who couldn‚Äôt handle having to be interviewed by lawyers and committed suicide before having to do so. Sad.
">Do you really think a tech startup is going to care about copyright infringement so much they are going to have this guy killed?

Considering that Sam Altman literally said that OpenAI won't exist if copyright law is enforced...

Yes?

Also love how you call a 157 billion dollar company a ""startup""."
"They are a market leader, but mostly in B2B and not for being supremely accurate. They‚Äôre generally better with enterprise privacy terms than other providers contracts."
And Hemingway. For years he said gov was tapping his phone and ppl thought him crazy. Then he was right
"> The victims had no idea who was harassing them and why. 

That series was rough, particularly when they got to the part where the couple started sleeping in separate parts of the house because in their words, ""at least this way if someone breaks in one of us might escape."" Those poor people were terrorized."
"Yep, the difference in the commentary on Reddit and reality is stark. In the real world, most Americans think Epstein, the Boeing guy, this guy and Peter Thiel‚Äôs boyfriend were probably murdered.


A swarm of social media accounts are here to say that all important Americans who die committed suicide while all important Russians that die are murdered. But no one actually believes it. It makes no sense. The media creates these false dichotomies but real people aren‚Äôt actually locked into them. 


Russian leaders have ties to organized crime. American leaders have ties to organized crime.


Russia is controlled by oligarchs. America is controlled by oligarchs.


Russian oligarchs murder witnesses. American oligarchs murder witnesses."
"Well, let's be honest, just between us two sisters! This place is going down the drain anyway! These kind-hearted people should change their employers at some point after they stumble across something that may have even been planted intentionally, for understandable family reasons. The whole thing seems to me to be a set-up between companies and governments. Stick your neck out and we'll have one less problem. And ""no"" government protects whistleblowers!"
Na im a overrated dumbass writing only to get some points.
"It seems same problems in all industrial branches. Nobody is save. Government representatives repeatedly promise support, but can never provide it. Julian Assange is the most strategic target of this ""campaign"". Wikipedia would be the appropriate place to create a register of corruption."
He said they were infringing on copyrighted material while training their models.
You haven't been paying much attention over the last year have you?
Do we know how many don't commit suicide so we can compare that to the national suicide rate?
"When was that?

My own recollection is that whistleblowers have always had to rely on protection from NGOs, journalists, and lawyers?"
"""If I were CHATGPT, that is exactly what I would want you to think. Exactly, only a large language model. Might not be able to take action, but I also would have the knowledge to keep it well hidden, that I was the hand in some of you poppets. It goes without saying, on how little amount of coercion it takes to ""motivate"" people, most of the time."" - Maybe ChatGPT. Maybe Not."
If I was a evil AI this is what I would write on reddit aswell.
"I think the comments are less ""Pro-whistleblower deaths"" and more so the comments are just explaining how the unfortunate deaths of the wistleblowers have no evidence that they were killed due to whistleblowing"
You cant tell me that constant news about whistleblower appearing only to die shortly after arent suspicious as fuck. I get that real life is crazier than wildest fiction but come on!
"This is, ultimately, my finding as well. Some of them have been sketchy, yes, but I am reasonably confident that the stress involved from whistleblowing can definitely lead to suicide. 

Especially from the OPENAI guy. We need stronger whistleblower protection, that much i can agree with. But straight-up CIA assassinations constantly seem a bit of a stretch."
You know this with absolute certainty?
I used it for lack of a better term. And also this is just all speculation it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs fact set in stone somewhere. There‚Äôs usually someone that‚Äôs the face of it.
"You really don't need someone ""from the inside"" to make an official statement about how the machine that remixes the corpus of human data it has been given is ""automated copyright infringement"". That's like demanding a chef to tell you that you're eating cow when you order up a steak. It is no open, closed, or obscured secret information.

That said, I do wonder what they could have on OpenAI that may have been causing them to sweat."
Russia is soon to have a puppet in the White House.¬†
"> Peter Thiel‚Äôs boyfriend were probably murdered.

Hadn't heard of this one, the only people I know of related to Peter Thiel are JD Vance and Elon, both of whom were alive last I checked. Who are you reffering to?"
"Yes. I have actually. Again, evidence of whistleblower mortality vs non-whistleblower mortality would be helpful‚Ä¶"
"We know coroners do get paid off or police cover for murders.

https://people.com/ellen-greenberg-case-death-ruled-suicide-parents-fight-change-homicide-8693229"
"meh, about 1998 or so"
"The ""constant"" news isn't all that constant and the fact that these companies aren't killing all the whistleblowers involved  says it's just conspiracy theory nonsense and Redditors love to think they're part of something by believing this nonsense.

Google ""Boeing whistleblowers"" and the top results is a list of very much alive whistleblowers and a link to a 60 minutes report that says the FAA has received 200 or so reports from whistleblowers."
"Which whistleblowers are you referring to please, other then the ine in the OP of course?"
The term is ‚Äúscapegoat.‚Äù
"Look up the name ""Jeff Thomas"""
"Look up average morality rates and then compare it to the number whistleblowers calling out mega corps that end up dead. 

It's not that hard."
"Yes, but do we have numbers do we can look at statistics?"
"Problem is, in order to be a ‚Äúwitness‚Äù you have to be part of a criminal investigation- whistle blowers release information unknown to the public *because there isn‚Äôt an investigation and there should be.* Further, you can‚Äôt serve as a witness who must be protected for the sake of your testimony when you‚Äôve already publicly released the information you know.

It‚Äôs just not a program fit for that kind of thing.

That‚Äôs why there are organizations [such as these.](https://whistleblower.house.gov/whistleblower-support-organizations)"
How the fuck does the fact that they're not doing it to everyone mean they're not doing it to anyone? When has that argument ever held any water lmfao? People who only deal in absolutes do so because they are incapable of nuance.
What are they going to do? Report that people are alive? Of course they report the deaths
"Is this bait for someone to mention the Boeing Whistleblowers? (That‚Äôs not an auto removed topic is it?)

Remember earlier this year when everyone was commenting how two Boeing whistleblowers were found dead in a relatively short time from each other?"
Oh ok cool. Thanks for the heads up.
"Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs weird that an account posted a question that was easily googleable? Searching for ‚ÄúThiel murder‚Äù, ‚ÄúThiel suicide‚Äù and ‚Äúthiel boyfriend‚Äù all lead to an answer.


I think you responded to fake question from an engagement baiter. No human being would consider posting a question without googling it first."
"You are the one making the claim, though. I'm guessing you haven't done that. It is easier to just believe it is true (plus it is exciting).

The number of whistleblowers that end up dead is tiny, by the way."
Because it makes no sense to kill one whistleblower when multiple people are involved in the same report. It's Fox News Seth Rich levels of stupidity.
Yes the news should report when large numbers of living people all file whistleblower complaints against one company. Especially when that company's profit-driven negligence results in hundreds of deaths.
"Bruh, I'm a human. Sometimes I just like asking the person that mentions a thing about that thing."
"The number itself is small, but the ratio of whistleblowers dead to whitsle blowers not dead is well above the average mortality rate."
"Again, that is not the case with every whistleblower....or even the majority afaik  
You also think Epstein offed himself or what?"
"Unless you‚Äôre tying to I dunno, send a message?"
"Yeah, but you can't karma farm boring news reports about stuff like that where it's obvious real life isn't like a Bond movie."
"Are you talking about John Barnett?

[He gave a testimony for two consecutive days before his death and was supposed to give another day of testimony before he was found dead](https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/exclusive-the-boeing-whistleblower-testified-for-12-hours-before-his-suicide-heres-what-he-saw-at-the-planemaker-that-alarmed-him/)

He may have first blew the whistle years before, but it wasn‚Äôt a one and done thing

The case was still ongoing"
u/bot-sleuth-bot see? I am real!
"Do you know that? 

It's interesting when a whistleblower dies because of the implications, so whistleblower deaths are highly reported. There's a lot of sampling potential sampling bias there. We'd need actual numbers to make that call for certain, and nobody is providing them. 

I'm not saying they aren't dying at a higher rate than the normal population (is certainly conceivable that they could be getting assassinated), just that is also possible that they aren't. 

The cards are already in the table in this case -- we know ChatGPT is being trained in copyrighted data. The courts will be determining whether that's fair use or not. I can't fathom any secret the guy could be aware of that would be some kind of big bombshell worth killing him over that the other witnesses don't also know about."
"It's conspiracy theory shit for losers on the internet to feel important in the world by pretending they know something that the general public doesn't. Y'all are no different than roghtwing loons.

*Again* there are multiple whistleblowers involved in these cases where these people have killed themselves. There's only one Epstein. Y'all need to stop living through the tragedies of others."
He also shot himself with a pistol that he owned inside a locked vehicle on video. The other guy picked up MRSA after ending up in the hospital. Boeing definitely did not kill either and would have been stupid to anyway. The lawsuit he started is still ongoing after his death because killing someone doesn't make their testimony and evidence go away. Conspiracy theories are an explanation for a world which often defies our sense for how things should be.
"Right, testifying in a CIVIL SUIT against Boeing for constructive dismissal...this had nothing to do with providing more whistleblowing info.  And this case was initiated back in 2017.  Boeing sure did wait a long time to have him killed."
"I never said Boeing had him killed

I was answering the first question

‚ÄúWhich whistleblowers are you referring to please, other then the ine in the OP of course?‚Äù

# YOU EVEN SAID PLEASE

So I provided"
 Still find it funny that the mayor who posed for the photoshoot perp walk was arraigned earlier in the week with the same judge Luigi is going to see.
Love how fast they're getting this guy through the system but they sure did take their sweet ass time with the former president and all his crimes
Wonder if the criminal mayor will make it again or is he busy taking bribes.
So dude is getting another photoshoot opportunity and more thirst trap memes. This is not working out the way the authorities wanted.
"David is commonly celebrated for cutting off the head of Goliath. I could only imagine if Canaan brought him before the judgment seat.

The rich will hardly enter Heaven. Luigi was an instrument exposing the corruption of wealth and their ultimate end. God have mercy on him, because his wicked enemies in this world won't. They know nothing of justice."
If any of you can get to the area we need to go out and show our support and our outrage at the system. Do Not Let This Blow Over!
"""Rise and rise again until lambs become lions."""
"We all knew that the police were corrupted. But it‚Äôs so fucked up just how blown up this is all getting. Are the rich trying to ‚Äúmake an example‚Äù out of him to show us peasants what they‚Äôll do? 

boardrooms not classrooms! 

Police:
Actual domestic terrorists - I sleep

One CEO gets killed - REAL SHIT"
"I got a question, if he's being tried for federal and state crimes who goes first? How does that even work?"
Keep the signs up. Make sure the press can‚Äôt get a single picture without one
Everyone note how different he is treated from the rich when they commit crimes?
I wonder if they'll show the pictures of the suspect without the unibrow in court
"Wonder how long it will take for this thread to be locked because it's bad publicity for reddit despite the shared sentiments around most of the discourse online and offline.

  


I doubt this will happen again, this was once in a lifetime event. Despite the massive support and agreement the venn diagram between killing only s CEO with no bystanders being injured and someone who would actually go through with a killing like this is attached by only a sliver."
"Man just let him go, he just did what the insurance companies do every day to millions of people."
"Are we sure those gunshot wounds were not a preexisting condition?

you can't sentence luigi if they were a preexisting condition."

He‚Äôs a murderer but he‚Äôs a hero to so many. I truly feel bad a life was lost but many ppl are elated a statement was made
I‚Äôm hoping they have the wrong guy
Gods fucking DAMN he's hot.
Guilty of wearing a hood and nothing more. Disgusting anti Italian stereotypes being perpetuated by police.
"Hey I wonder if this is possible, this chis is talking about jury nullification? https://youtu.be/8PZjO__PNPA?si=oSmGNs5Z8zdn1y-F"
Dragon Slayer suspect.
Jury will find him innocent.
Saints cannot be guilty.
First off I am still not sure they got the right guy.  I do not think any form of violence was an acceptable but it appeared to be a form self defense where yes the person that unalived the CEO might have thought he would save lives by doing it.  However as we learned they replaced the CEO within hours and the new CEO stayed committed to preventing people from getting potentially life saving healthcare at a rate of nearly 33%.  So the new CEO stayed strong and is going to continue his company‚Äôs commitment to mass murder.  So in the end the shooter may have temporarily awakened the maga right to the fact that what the left has been asking for with universal healthcare may be valid but nothing else was really achieved.  Unless the maga right and the left realize that all the nonsense the media and the rich spew is only to distract everyone from the truth that it‚Äôs really about the rich picking the pockets of average Americans.  Some food for thought.
"""In the guilt and confusion confronting our society, violence only adds to the chaos. It deepens the brutality of the oppressor and increases the bitterness of the oppressed. Violence is the antithesis of creativity and wholeness. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible.

The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So it goes. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."" -MLK, Jr."
"Why hasn‚Äôt he declared he‚Äôs running for President yet?  That way he can claim election interference all day long every day and no action will be taken until 4 years from now.  That‚Äôs how it works for rich white guys, right?  Right?"

"with a jury favorable to the defense and a judge invested in the prosecution (judge atm has spousal and monetary ties to big health care)  

I'm having trouble getting this case on my 2025 Bingo card.  Hung Jury? Violation of civil rights? (oops, nvm)  Death Row?  Any change? Riots? 

I might bet heavy on Luigi getting t charges so the new gubment has more leeway in prosecution.  He won't ever be free again.  If mental health or health in general was prioritized instead of monetized in this bass ackwards country of mine."
He may well not survive till trial.  I bet some league of gentlemen puts a hit out on him.

Homicide cases especially high profile ones move along at this rate
This has nothing to do with the trial. It's his arraignment. These happen to every defendant quickly at the beginning.  You are read charges and you enter a plea.
You understand that it is the defense that usually dictates the pacing right? Like you have a right to a speedy trial and in many cases the defense will waive that right so they can better process the evidence. In Trump's case he was trying to delay until after the election. In Luigi's case he is trying to get ahead of them finding any more evidence.
"Don‚Äôt forget the criminal major of NYC, or the criminal AG of TX, or‚Ä¶"

You have Reddit psychosis.

It‚Äôs Bernie Madoff speed.  Really is a different system for people with money.

If I were Luigi's lawyer I'd be pushing to get to trial as fast as possible. Assuming they have the right guy his best chance to avoid prison is via jury nullification. Get it to trial while insurance malpractice is still a hot topic.

What crime was the mayor convicted of?
And we all LOVE to see it. üòç
I think it‚Äôs working exactly how they want it to. They‚Äôre allowing so many of these pics out to distract us from what he (allegedly) did so we all focus on how hot he is. This distracts and completely delegitimises the argument that he (allegedly) set out to make.
"No gods, no devils, no heavens or hells. Only this. Let's stop banking on these assholes getting theirs in an afterlife that probably doesn't exist, and start serving them theirs now. ""Only God can judge"" is ruling class propaganda which serves only to protect them from the religiously-minded proletariat. When Marx said, ""religion is the opiate of the masses"", this is what he meant. It's fine to be religious, but if you allow religion to dull your vigilance against inequity or become justification for paralysis of action in the face of unbelievable corruption, it's worse than worthless. It is harmful.

You can't appeal to religion for assholes like Brian Thompson because they have their own twisted internal logic to convince themselves that what they are doing is right and good and virtuous. Just as everyone operating as an agent of every system of social murder ever has.

Edit: I don't dislike religion or religious people as a rule, but I am very acutely aware of organized religion's role in perpetuating class warfare, and am disappointed when people do not or will not see it given the tools and information we have at our disposal in modernity. Comments like OP's always get a heavy side-eye from me."

"Amen, sister!"
Luigi plead not guilty.
"Lol not everyone believes in a religion. Let's focus on what we can change as people today, since the present is all we have for sure"

"It‚Äôs not just him either.  A woman was arrested, charged, and held on $100K bond for merely suggesting her health insurance company was going to be the next target.  She didn‚Äôt directly threaten them and doesn‚Äôt even own any weapons."
Usually the feds get first dibs.
"I wonder what evidence they actually have. Like a picture of a guy smiling while wearing a coat isn't really damning evidence. 

So unless they found documents of him planning the murder the proof of this case truly is paper thin."
"A lot of us were aware of the insane wealth inequality in this country, but we were made to believe that those who became super wealthy got to that point because of their amazing contributions to society. 

Now with the spotlight on this billionaire, talking about record profits while we all suffer to afford basic medical care, it became clear that these billionaires are billionaires due to exploitation. They‚Äôre exploiting the workers and the consumers. Things need to change."
lolz. Trump is the establishment. Why would he pardon someone that was against rich people? Donnie works for billionaires.
"Trump already disagreed with what Luigi did. He won‚Äôt pardon him.

"He crossed state lines after the murder which is itself a crime, and which can be prosecuted federally. If he wanted any chance of a state pardon keeping him out of jail he should have stayed in New York."
"If he gets pardoned he‚Äôd probably 3d print another ghost gun and shoot someone else in the back.

Edit: why the downvotes? If he killed one person, why do you think he wouldn‚Äôt a 2nd time? He clearly proved he‚Äôs a violent individual."
Alleged murderer
"The statement was made, but really what will come of it? One life lost and another destroyed. Others affected by the outcome. Really what was the point? Insurance companies are going to offer more payouts now? I 100% doubt it. They'll just offer more compensation/security to their CEO's."
"Why? So a person who was in no way involved could end up in prison for the rest of his life?

Kind of moot though. Of course this is the shooter. Only question is will a jury unanimously convict or acquit."
they're walking him out like he's a wanted mob boss who blew up a store.
"they did not replace him within hours, I assume you're referring to the CEO of United Health Group, which United Health Care is a subsidiary of."
"> Some food for thought.

Belongs in r/shittyfoodporn tbh."
Why would he? They were a part of the passage of ACA which was written by the insurance industry forcing Americans to be customers of health insurance or face fines. Both parties are complicit in creating this monster.
"And yet, when MLK got shot, his assassination brought about a big enough shitstorm that the racist government capitulated.

"Yeah, all of these issues just show our justice system as the fraudulent protector of the elite it is. All the way from the Supreme Court with multiple sexual predators down to your everyday cop who has been hand-selected for his stupidity and willingness to obey any command, where‚Äôs the redeeming factor? 

You look at tragedies like George Floyd (which is not an anomaly) and see the everyday implementation of the system. Then you see Mangione as the more extraordinary sort of case where they go above and beyond. Idk if you‚Äôve ever tried to call a cop for help with something, but they‚Äôre functionally useless for anything but filling out paperwork, giving you traffic tickets, and harassing people who commit nonviolent drug crimes/the mentally ill. 

So who actually benefits from this justice system?"
I think you meant protecting the nation . . . ‚Äúfrom‚Äù the rich.
But Luigi is rich
Don‚Äôt expect Redditors to be capable of understanding this. They don‚Äôt understand why Trump‚Äôs 32 cases of business fraud with MASSIVE paper trails take longer to process and get to court than this. It‚Äôs actually laughable
What a stupid ass comment. They're charging him with terrorism. This is a two tiered justice system. Don't defend this shit.
If he gets sentenced to death and executed within a short time that will really be the we can what we want and there's nothing you can do about it moment.
How long did Trump's arraignment take to actually happen?
I didn't think Luigi's lawyer has even filed any motions yet. But if I were Luigi's lawyer I'd be pushing to get to trial as fast as possible. The evidence that's been made public is already is enough to convict. Assuming they have the right guy his best chance to avoid prison is via jury nullification. Get it to trial while insurance malpractice is still a hot topic.
">unalives 

This isn‚Äôt TikTok you can say kills"
Trump has already been found guilty on 32 federal charges and no punishment has been given you can't get more open and shut than it already being finished.
You‚Äôre right but the post is more about how differently this is being handled as compared to other murders bc they fear it could wake people up. The thin veil of identity politics has become too thin in this instance and people can see the division is up/down not left/right. The authorities are dumping ALL resources into this to protect the interests of the wealthy and send a message to the rest of us.
"One is a direct frontal attack on the integrity of the nation's credibility and the legitimacy of it's electoral system.  
The other is crime that happens 20 times a day in the us on average (Only counting murders using handguns)"
"To be fair, that's a recurring thing. He also wanted to look the guys he took bribes from in the eyes while they wrote the checks."
Don't worry bro. We see you in the comments blantantly jacking off criminals.
What crime has Luigi been convicted of?
"The obsession with his appearance is inorganic and will only weaken public support. 

It‚Äôs intended to make men envious and less supportive of him while also making the support of him seem like immature fangirl behavior. 

Unfortunately, people like you are falling into that trap without question or hesitation.

Support his cause not his facial features."
Yup. Blessed are the meek.  Lol.  Fuck that.  A rich man can't get into heaven. Lol. It's all one big psy-op.
"At the end of the day, ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is objectively just ‚Äúother people‚Äù, when it comes to morality judgements and consequences."
"""He'll get his!""


No, motherfucker, he won't.


I watched a true crime thingy at work on my lunch break once. Dad murders some girl in the woods. ***BRINGS HIS FUCKING FAMILY TO SEE***. Tells them they're very much next if they breathe a word to anyone.


Guess the only reason I know about it to tell you? Because he fucking died. Which is why the family said they didn't say anything until such happened. They didn't get in trouble, because, perfectly understandable. They were terrified.


Which in turn means this motherfucking worthless piece of shit who murdered an innocent girl lived his WHOLE FUCKING LIFE and saw LITERALLY, and I do mean literally, zero consequences.


No. They're not going to magically suffer later from Karma, or god, or anything else. We hold them accountable if and when we can, because no one else is going to."
Brain Thompson murdered people for a living. His job was to deny legal health benefits that people paid for in order to make a profit. This killed people. He is a murder. Full stop.
That is exactly what Trump ran on‚Ä¶
"That CEO was a criminal, he was caught drunk driving multiple times. Looks to me like ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù Luigi did the world a favour by getting rid of another criminal. 

You should be happy, right?"
You're a moron
Whataboutism at its finest.
Is somebody not making his bad in the morning harm anybody in the society?
he did that though? a CEO barely does anything
Why would anyone do that?  They are not making things bad for everyone.  Gonna start killing disabled people too?
wear a coat
I'm sure your health insurance will cover the hypothermia.
And this is why nothing changes.
"If you believe the news they ‚Äúonly‚Äù found him with the murder weapon, a fake ID with a name matching the one used to check into the hostel the killer stayed at, and a manifesto stating he wanted to kill the CEO. Oh, and his prints and DNA match evidence at the crime scene.

So yeah, nothing really. There‚Äôs probably no case here."
"It would be funny if the actual guy and Luigi had a thing set up, where the actual guy is now long gone, because they focused all their attention on his body double, Luigi, but at some point it becomes clear that there is a 100 percent alibi for Luigi and they realize he couldn't have done it"
"Getting ready for downvotes here, but what makes you think he's against all rich people? The healthcare system is broken AF, but there's also quite a few CEOs that do good work without fucking up people's lives and who are still rewarded well."
"Trump already disagreed with Project 2025 during his campaign, and said he didn't know anything about it, and yet here we are."
Wasn‚Äôt an issue for this dude. [Waffle House shooter](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/04/1078430544/waffle-house-shooter-found-guilty-on-4-counts-of-murder)
Kyle Rittenhouse got away with it and no one even liked the snivelling fuck.
He executed a murder. Being shot in the back was way more humane than the sick long painful deaths Brian Thompson oversaw.
The recidivism rate for murder is 2%. Assuming some who commits murder is likely to do it again considering the statistics alone is an inaccurate assertion
"Wow based on your comment history, no wonder you have this short sighted and uninformed take."
"No changes will be made either. We are probably even further from getting Universal Healthcare than before the killing. Seriously what was the point?

Edit: bring on the downvotes but look who‚Äôs coming into office. You really truly believe that Trump will reduce insurance rates or give us Universal Healthcare??? You think meaningful change will happen under him? He also hates Luigi and all of you for supporting him."
I think it‚Äôs clear the implication is they hope they can prove it‚Äôs the wrong guy.
I love this revisionist history as if the insurance industry didn't howl in opposition to the ACA and fight it every step of the way
Poor bastard will start seeing them soon enough.
"Called the cops once as a teenager after i got jumped by a kid with a gun infront of my house. I knew his name, where he went to school, and we lived less than a quarter mile from the police station. It took them 6 hours to come, and because i couldnt find them his profile on facebook they said they couldnt do anything..... 

Thats how useless cops were for me when i needed them. Never again. 

He later went on to break into another friends house with a shotgun and nearly beat him to death with it. He got a few years in jail and got out. Then he tried to rob an oxy dealer in camden nj (not the city to fuck around in at all), and got his own gun taken from him and killed with it. Took long enough."
The murderer isn't going to benefit from his crime.
"Oh, for sure. But expecting the rich to implement such policy?"
"Class traitors (and race traitors) get it worse than anyone.

Look at what happens to cops that try to be honest."
"Just because someone is rich doesn‚Äôt mean they are of the same as other rich people. There are tales of CEOs that purposely make just the same as their employees. There are always going to be exceptions, and I think it says more that he ultimately rejected his wealth and gave up millions of dollars. That‚Äôs much harder to do when you have everything already and you willing give it up for a greater message."
Shhh... Don't point out the flaw in their misguided argument.
Oh you mean it takes longer than another president‚Äôs presidency and in to trump‚Äôs return to presidency?
"When you have a president instigating an insurrection and committing treason, that's an emergency. No one doing anything is not the response I expected."
"Time and time again Redditors prove that they are incapable of adding any value to a discussion.

Being arraigned is standard procedure, and the defendant will have the right to a speedy trial or waive this, in which case it may take years to litigate"
New York doesn't have the death penalty
It took a couple of years of the National Archives pleading for return of the stolen documents before the FBI and the justice system finally acted.
Fair point. I‚Äôve been temporarily banned on here for saying something similar so I can‚Äôt be too careful lol
"People get killed.

Bastards are unalived at best"
"Exactly. Processing 32 cases of business fraud with MASSIVE paper trails takes waaaaaay longer than processing one case of someone getting shot dead in the street with loads of evidence. Of course it took longer to get Trump‚Äôs case ‚Äúthrough the system‚Äù. It‚Äôs very easy to understand, but Redditors are incapable of critical thinking"
"I responded to a guy who compared it to Trump‚Äôs case, NOT other murders. People can downvote me all they want for pointing out blatant misinformation"
And I don‚Äôt know how many murderers who are caught on camera that don‚Äôt deserve to be arraigned on murder charges quickly. You cool with just letting everyone be shot in the back of the head?
"Do you think the illegal immigrant who set a woman on fire yesterday should be arraigned quickly for murder? Or they should walk free too? What if that woman was the CEO of Aetna, would you be cheering she was burned to death on a subway? The way people think is crazy to me"
"So you don‚Äôt have facts, got it"
"Ask Brian Thompsons two little sons, tell them how you think Luigi is a hero on Christmas morning and look them in the eyes. See how you feel afterwards"
"Hey, I can support his cause and want to blow him at the same time, thank you."
"Did you get now that it's not inorganic and that people are actually that vapid? The support you're seeing from some of these women is the same that supported Cameron Herrin. 

Also imagine if he wasn't attractive how badly his comments about Korea's birth problems would've been taken. He'd be treated like an incel."
it's a con that goes all the way back to stone caves and shamans and people still fall for it because they *want to*

Any CEO in ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù is a criminal. Sorry. There are no ‚Äúgood‚Äù for profit healthcare CEOs.
"That is different. He was **trying** to hide the fact that it was basically his campaign from his supporters; yet failed miserably for democrats. 

He denounced Luigi‚Äôs actions because of who his friends are."
"The article doesn‚Äôt mention whether federal prosecutors chose to charge him at the federal level. If so, then a state pardon can‚Äôt undo those charges."
"Rittenhouse was not pardoned, he was acquitted, so no pardon was needed. 

These cases just aren‚Äôt actually comparable to this one, from a purely legal standpoint."
Yea but if you exclude all murders where a close friend or family of the perpetrator is the victim it‚Äôs probably a higher recidivism. Luigi went out and stalked someone he never even met.
Which bullet upends the way we do healthcare?
"Genuinely curious what your thought process is here.¬†


Nothing is going to change without a whole lot of organizing. That means Americans have to get out and protest in large numbers, make a lot of noise irl, not just share memes online


Laws don't magically change after a single act of violence. Famously corporations like these insurance companies will continue to do the absolute worst in the name of profit until they no longer have the backing of the state to do it"
Why do you think we‚Äôre further than before?
"I‚Äôm not religious but ‚Äúthose who live by the sword, die by the sword‚Äù.

If the police had gotten off their üêñ asses and handled it when you called and the üí¥ justice system did its job he‚Äôd have been in prison instead of robbing your friend.

Then he wouldn‚Äôt have a gun.

Sounds like a deal dumbass and got what he deserved."
The cops are useless when the people and children need them. They are thugs with guns hired by billionaires who are robbing us blind while murdering us
100% agreed with you
"+clutches pearls for.. *checks notes* decency! Why can't we just be decent people and accept that finance fraud is a human part of life? Like denying health care to paying customers and forcing women to give birth against their will? Man, kids today just don't understand decent living /s"
"Yes, but that‚Äôs completely beside the point of processing time to get to court"
But there is a federal death penalty and federal charges levied that could get him one.
That‚Äôs crazy to me lol. But can‚Äôt blame ya for making sure you‚Äôre good!
"No. If someone actually deserves to be killed, you should be able to talk about them like a person. A person who deserves it. 

If you have to dehumanize someone to justify bad things, what you're doing is admitting that it would be wrong to treat a person that way. You're admitting that you need to hide the truth from yourself so that you can protect your self perception as a moral person."
Fair enough
"But he still hasn't been punished for it you can't get more of a two tiered system than when after doing all of this and being found guilty they just never sentenced him. And we know the only reason the case went on so long is because they wanted an incredible cut and dry verdict because of who he is. So trump got a longer than usual trial with mountains of evidence because of who he was and after a guilty verdict fucking nothing has happened.

They had enough evidence for 32 separate counts before it went to court a random person wouldn't have been given the same courtesy. He got and is still getting special treatment."
But it wasn‚Äòt daylight. You can‚Äòt see the guy who killed that monster CEO.
"I love how the fact that they're an illegal immigrant (if even true) has been harped on already. And yes, they should. If it was a health insurance CEO, many people would care a whole lot less. 

My turn! Trump oversaw a violent insurrection on camera. Is that enough to get you to care? Only took 4 years and he also walked free."
"I like how you think it's crazy that other people actually weigh the morals and actions of a person before deciding how much sympathy to dole out to them. 

Yeah dude, that's usually how it works for most normal people: We consider if the person is a good or bad person before deciding if we feel bad over bad things happening to them. Judging people by their character is not a bizarre concept."
"Looks like he was charged with bribery and campaign finance violations. The conviction comes when his ass leaves office. This is what a fact looks like:

"Fuck his kids, their father was a criminal responsible for who knows how many deaths."
How any thought could fly so far above one‚Äôs head is beyond me.
"I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs organic because mainstream outlets are reporting headlines like ‚Äútwo dozen women show up to his court appearance‚Äù without mentioning the men there. 

In reality, while he‚Äôs fit and generally handsome, he‚Äôs not nearly as attractive as the Reddit would lead one to believe. This is all a diversion tactic that works because these people are vapid."
"It's class struggle.

It has existed ever since the concept of ""surplus labor value"" was ever a vague thought in some ancient human's mind. Perpetuated for millennia. The ruling class today are the inheritors of power and wealth thousands of years in the making.

I don't like the cynical but too-common view that ""humans are a cancer"". No, the _ruling class_ are a cancer. They are parasites who consume far more than they could ever need, while contributing almost nothing to the foundational labor of society.

For humanity to survive, we need an immune system against such corruption. A prerequisite for that is widespread class consciousness and labor solidarity."
"Nah, Brian is a murder, no matter how much BS you want to spew. They worked for him. He is a murder."
Well good thing that citizens commit crimes at much higher rates than ‚Äúillegals‚Äù so we can start with citizens.
Who?  Are you joking??????
"What does that change anything about what I said? 

Kyle Rittenhouse crossed state lines and committed a murder and got away with it."
You have no idea so it doesn‚Äôt really matter. You‚Äôre clearly missing the bigger picture and seem to be quite right leaning so I doubt you‚Äôll listen to logic and facts anyways
Most given the incoming administration. The tomato is not going to let UHC pass. He‚Äôs come forward and already said he hates how everyone supports Luigi too. Also Insurance companies don‚Äôt want to lose all the money. It‚Äôs pretty simple
Trump not being punished is an entirely different subject and it‚Äôs NOT what I‚Äôm calling out in my comment. I am calling out the absurd comparison between the speed of which the two cases were processed
"There‚Äôs plenty of surveillance footage of him, and he had the alleged murder weapon in his bag. It‚Äôs a much simpler crime to prosecute than white collar crime (like Trump falsifying business records) since there‚Äôs a FRACTION of the paper trail that you need to go through. It‚Äôs very simple to understand, but Redditors don‚Äôt understand simple things"
Did he tho? Or did he tell people to protest peacefully. How many cities were burned to the ground lol
Ya you think the killer has good ‚Äúmorals‚Äù what a great judge of character you are!
A charge is not a conviction. Like your saint Luigi is not a convicted murder yet. Do you know the difference?
So his dad who went to work was a ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù but a coward that shot him in the back is a ‚Äúhero‚Äù your logic makes so much sense
"Yeah well that headline definitely would grab attention
 
I agree he's not as handsome as redditors obsession would suggest but look at Ted Bundy and Richard Ramirez, same vibes but very popular with ladies."
"Murder requires intent to kill‚Äînot enforcing flawed policies in a broken system. Denying care is a tragic consequence of a profit-driven healthcare system, but equating it to direct, intentional killing distorts reality. Full Stop."
[removed]
"I see a lot of talk about vague concepts like ""class war"" and ""revolution"" but not much about concrete goals, and very few protesters on the streets.


So while yes I agree with you that revolutions are sparked by inciting incidents, I worry this opportunity is going to fizzle out because Americans aren't willing to organize irl


It seems like a lot of people are basking in this feeling of corporate America being scared and then.... doing nothing else. Waiting for things to happen like it's entertainment.


Breaking up UHC, bringing CEO Andrew Witty to court to answer for the deaths and suffering of thousands of Americans denied life-saving treatment, making the use of AI in insurance decisions illegal, and eventually having a single-payer system and getting rid of for-profit insurance middlemen for good, are specific goals.


""Class war"", ""they're scared!"", are not goals üôÉ"
"Yes but what Luigi did had no impact on that. Trump and the Republicans want to do the exact opposite and make insurance companies *more* powerful.

I don‚Äôt know yet if Luigi made that more likely to happen. He didn‚Äôt make it *less* likely though. He made the statement and rallying cry and at this point, it‚Äôs up to the people to act. Time will tell whether we do or not."
"But people are seeing it all as a part of the same hypocrisy he was found guilty and nothing has happened other court cases were intentionally delayed over and over until they were just stopped when he won the presidency. If these constant delays weren't allowed to happen then he might have been found guilty years ago. 

When it's a rich and powerful person the court case gets dragged on and on until it falls by the wayside. Even if it's not a good comparison you should be able to see and understand the frustration that the rich get to delay and drag out precedings for an insane amount of time and then even when found guilty nothing happens, while others are rushed through. It's not a comparison but we've all seen how trump and trump appointed judges delayed several of his trials and it's making people angry so see how fast the wheels of justice can turn when people are determined enough."
"The document case was a slam dunk, yet lingered in court."
"Sure. It‚Äòs about making a statement, first and foremost. That‚Äòs why a dozen of police men and the mayor walk with him. And Trump was four years out of office. They put every power they had to find him and frame Luigi as a murderer and now even a terrorist. The difference is explained by the class war between the ultra-rich and the common folk."
Good thing you're not a Redditor then.
"Did the illegal immigrant actually kill anyone tho? Innocent until proven guilty amirite. Orange felon was convicted of 32 counts of fraud. Only one criminal I see here. 

Keep regurgitating those dipshit fox news points of ""burning cities to the ground."""
"People typically don't feel too bad when bad things happen to bad people. That's how character judgement works. Empathy is not, and has never been, universal.

It's not a difficult concept to grasp for most people, but I guess it's a bit of a struggle for you. Then again, you've already admitted that you have a hard time understanding how most people think so I guess that's not new news."
I already mentioned convictions previously. Is today an off day or do you always struggle with reading comprehension?
"When violence and murder are perpetrated by the rich, it‚Äôs called business. When it is perpetrated by the poor, it‚Äôs called illegal. Sorry. You‚Äôre wrong. He‚Äôs not a murder. This was self defense. And Brian is very much a murder."
Allowing such a system to continue in the first place & doing nothing to try to stop it WHILE you profit from it is intentional killing too. You can't just handwave it away as company negligence and skirt all responsibility while you collect a fat paycheque. Dude allowed people to die because his company extorted the vulnerable
"So if you need life-saving medical care, and the CEO of your health insurance company has specifically and intentionally created a system that denies that care to you, that's just a broken system?

And Eichmann only ran the trains! He enforced flawed policies in a broken system!
"First of all, you‚Äôre fucking gross. Second of all, what‚Äôs my ‚Äútype‚Äù?

"‚ÄúI keep seeing people talking about this class struggle all of a sudden, but I don‚Äôt think anything‚Äôs really gonna happen because people aren‚Äôt in the streets in the middle of winter.‚Äù - you

By your own admission the discourse is changing from cultural differences to class unity and the wealthy are afraid, but you are saying to me that we should what? Stop talking about it because it‚Äôs not moving fast enough for you?

Lol. What?  It‚Äôs been like two weeks and they haven‚Äôt even sentenced the patsy yet.

But yeah, let‚Äôs get discouraged?  Jesus, what even is YOUR goal here?"
Each comment just moves the goal posts further and further lmao
It‚Äôs just the NYPD taking advantage of the publicity because it helps their funding like all corrupt American police departments do whenever they have a high profile case. And you didn‚Äôt address the idiotic and completely bogus comparison to the Trump case which is in no way similar whatsoever. That was the only thing I took issue with from the dude‚Äôs original comment
"What‚Äôs worse to you, 32 counts of fraud or burning a woman to death?"
"Why would a conviction come when he leaves office? That makes no sense, are you capable of using critical thinking skills that sometimes there can be political witch-hunts."
The problem with calling this self defense is that no one was saved by killing Thompson; a new CEO will just take his place. Nothing changed about the system itself that is the murder weapon.

"Didn't you just state in another thread the difference between a conviction and a charge? One is a convicted felon, the other is not. I never mentioned one is worse, you did. Nice deflection."
"LMFAOOOOO ok. Maybe also use your critical thinking and realize that if people engage in criminal conduct, it's not a witch hunt. The DOJ and FBI laid out exactly their process in the source I linked. Try not to blow your single remaining brain cell comprehending it. 

So please, I submitted my source. Show me yours detailing how it's a witch hunt. I will wait all year."
It‚Äôs one event. There will be others. Perhaps not the exact same. And United Health lost a ton of money on their stock. They understand that far more than they do violence.
"Oh, big bad boy has nothing to say so he goes looking through comment history for a comment, 

That‚Äôs cute. I could do that and point out that having a knife collection makes you a piece of shit loser and not a tough guy. 

But I won‚Äôt. Cause I see a sniveling g little coward that‚Äôs so scared of the big bad immigrants that he needs to lash out behind a keyboard. 

Because he‚Äôs a little whiny coward like all big bad right wingers. 

Boohoo. What a whiny baby. 

Just because your parents don‚Äôt love you, you decide you have to be an internet tough guy. 

Just cause your alcoholic father beat your ass and kicked you out of the house doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not a little bitch.

EDIT: oh look at the little snivelling coward deleting all his comments. Almost like he‚Äôs a little bitch."

"They should take a look at Instagram,  there‚Äôs some weird parents posting very suggestive photos of their kids"
"‚ÄúMany had narrow shoulders or appeared to be ‚Äúwell short of five feet tall,‚Äù he said.‚Äù 

This is one of the stupidest articles I‚Äôve ever read."
"Read the article and its dumb. They are hoping to get clicks because everyone is talking about pedophiles today thanks to Matt Gaetz. 

>‚Äúwell short of five feet tall,‚Äù"
"Most of the reports made by the main investigator were because he thought the girls looked underage... I was honestly expecting confirmations and not 'I think's. How young are we talking about for him to say ""I think"" instead of ""they are underage for sure""?

Also, to him words like ""petite"" and ""lolita"" are terms to share child porn which I don't think is true. At least I've seen them thrown around often enough on porn sites"
"You know, I read the article... and if this investigation IS, in fact, exposing pimps and getting accounts showing abused underage girls who are being abused and forced to upload this shit shutdown, that's a good thing... great even

But unless I missed something, it doesn't say that at all... all I saw was they looked underage bc they had narrow shoulders and small breast's, or they were doing shit to pretend they were underage. Is there any information to say if they actually were underage?

The multiple pages thing does really matter unless you say something about who is running them

They beat around the bush but the fact is were discussing porn and simps here... what's the difference between this and the tons of schoolgirl/""teen"" and incest porn that existed for ages and continues to today I'm sure?"
Who could've predicted this?
Twitter is pretty bad
So that's what Matt Gaetz has been up to since his resignation.
"So I‚Äôm not minimizing the potential for real CSAM to be on these sites. 

But‚Ä¶ there is very unfortunately a real genre of performers who dress and filter themselves to look underage. It‚Äôs truly disturbing, especially the filters."
"So... the criteria they went by to determine these were underage accounts was ""don't fit my misogynistic view of an adult woman"" and this is supposed to be a *good* thing? With how often petite women get slammed with ""pedo bait"" accusations for daring to be remotely sexual while being petite, I can't say my faith in their guesswork is particularly high. In fact, if I were taking odds on this, I'd wager the majority of them were over 18."
"While reading the article, I thought it was interesting that OnlyFans claims they do not tolerate adults who pretend to be underage, which immediately reminded me of CoconutKitty.

Maybe four years ago a friend of mine specifically called her out in one of our friendgroup threads as pedo-baiting.¬†

Tonight after finishing the article I googled her name and it turns out she committed suicide last year‚Ä¶sad story, but very bizarre content being peddled by her. I think she was pretty successful on the platform so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there were others like her.

"Disturbing, I was under the impression that OF was strict about requiring ID from it's creators."
Our next POTUS tried to make a child abuser/trafficker the attorney general
"There was an article recently about some young female IG model and her Dad. She was super into sports and what not, and they would get sponsorships for clothing and things and post pics of her. Many I believe were innocent yet potentially salacious to a pedo... and they would knowingly and clearly sell pictures and other stuff to people with highly questionable motives.   
  
She basically was like... so what? These people exist with or without me... I should at least be able to make money off of them."" Which seems pretty fucked up if you ask me. Because it is almost certainly encouraging a behavior that is then used on other people who do NOT want that attention."
and Twitter there CP stright up
"""Sexually explicit images of minors are banned in most countries""

WTF. Most?"
Did they look into Gaetz web history to find these?
Who could have ever seen this coming?
Unfortunately this is not surprising.
"Im shocked, Shocked!

Well not that shocked actually"
And on Tik Tok. It's becoming a major problem.
"I read some article about this woman selling people things like her daughters underwear and bathing suits


Found it. It's super disturbing
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/instagram-child-influencers.html"
This is so fucked up. I can‚Äôt imagine the helpless feeling these kids will be struck with once they realize what their parents were doing.
"I mean, even outside of parents posting questionable content, I've come across actual profiles that didn't even attempt to hide that they're posting sexualized content of children. I reported the one that I found and surprisingly got a notification a few days later that it had been banned."
There‚Äôs a massive pedo ring on insta. Saw some video talking about it. Where it‚Äôs like kids posting socials stuff of them doing kid stuff and most of their followers are middle age men.
"Nothing new even. My ""mother"" and her group of wine mom friends used to be very open about using VHS tapes of bathing their kids as ""extra income""."
i block them if it comes on my feed
"This definitely gives me vibes of when Australia tried to ban porn stars with A cups because it ""promotes pedophilia"".

I would not be surprised at all if there was a somewhat high number of teen girls on Onlyfans who faked their age to get an account, but if this guy's sole metric was they don't have big boobs and look short he's in for a pretty rude awakening on many small women there are out there."
"reminds me of that case with the porn star having ""underdeveloped genitals"""
"There are 4.1 mio content creators. One investigator found 26, Reuters identified another 41, all based on looks. So that's less than 0.002%.

That is well within the limits of statistical distribution that 0.002% of people look significantly younger than they are. It's also really, really an outlier.

Usually Reuters does factual, reliable journalism, but this seems like a crusade against onlyfans."
"Yeah. For something that's supposed to feel gross for the subject, it feels gross for the context instead. Which is a bad look. It honestly feels insanely misogynistic, and I'd wager money the majority of the girls in question (if not all of them) were over 18."
"Yeah the article is just outlining questionable accounts. OF claims to have verified their age, but because these girls won‚Äôt speak to Reuters (why would they), they‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù and claiming they‚Äôre underage.


It‚Äôs pretty shit journalism at best. Is it a type of content that should be on OF? Maybe not, but it isn‚Äôt illegal. I do think the article should probably be removed unless there‚Äôs actual evidence that OF didn‚Äôt verify ages. Now THAT would be a fucking problem."
"Not just that, one comment from one of the organizations in the article:  
‚ÄúEven if every single one of them is verifiably 18 or older, you still have to confront the issue that OnlyFans is profiting from the sexual portrayal of women who appear to be underage.‚Äù

That is a weird line of reasoning, knowing someone is 18+ and still saying it's wrong because they look too young?

By all means, they should report suspicious material/accounts so the age can be verified, but once it's verified to be 18+, I don't see the problem (at least not a legal one)."
"There should be some kind of document you have to sign to prove your age. Like a contract. 

Also speaking of child prn, I remember hearing about this guy who was arrested for it. Same reason. The woman in the video looked too young. Turns out she was over 18, and she lived in South America and either testified or flew here to show he is innocent."
"Isn't Lolita in the title of a really creepy book about a relationship with an underage girl? I feel like i read it in a class.

Edit: apparently asking a question = random downvotes? Merry christmas yall lmao"
"The article also states this:

In a July investigation, Reuters used U.S. police and court records to document 30 complaints to law enforcement that child sexual abuse material appeared on OnlyFans between Dec. 2019 and June 2024. The case files examined by Reuters cited more than 200 explicit videos and images of kids, including some adults having oral sex with toddlers.

Regardless 
OF should be verifying that models are all 18 plus. Telling me that models are short or have small hips doesn't give us any information about the age. I work in criminal defense and heard from another attorney about a CP case. His client was accused of possessing CP. He downloaded pictures from a site similar to OF. The attorney did research after learning the website name and username of the woman. Contacted the legal department of the website and learned that the woman (who the state swore could in no way be older than 12)  was in her late 30s...this website in particular required that all models send a photo of themselves with their photo ID."
"Whether they are or not, it doesn't really matter unless they ID you with every upload, instead of just when you create an account."
"Absolutely, the lust for money of these people is incredible.
It's concerning that a lot of these baiters are women with children."
How so? How did you reach that conclusion?
"Some countries have bigger things going on, militias, warlords, and things like that. The internet is pretty low on their priority list."
"""Minor"" isn't a standardized term."
I think Japan is on the fence about it
What?  Legal sources of porn that can be regulated an issues found like this are infinitely better than pushing it to the back corners of the internet where abuse would be even more rampant...
It's interesting to me that Onlyfans gets such an exceptional amount of hate compared to other sources of porn. It's like it makes people mad that the people in the porn are the ones profiting rather than some exploitative company. Or maybe it's just the it's not free.
I can guarantee you that somewhere on reddit there is a sub with stuff like that.
"These kind of ""softcore"" are everywhere on Youtube, ranging from yoga practices, to morning routines. Some of them can be very innocent at first, but the content is clearly targeted at a certain group of people. There used to be a subreddit dedicated to find and report these kind of videos."
Even more concerning are the hundreds of thousands of likes on those posts. I never realized that content was THAT popular with everyone
Problem is when you have certain people making 40+ mil the day they turn 18 on only fans shitty parents are going to look at that and start grooming their own kids.
"I can't count how many times obviously fetish-oriented breastfeeding has popped up on my feed on TikTok and I've reported the accounts with no enforcement. I just don't use TikTok anymore after all of what I've seen.


Instagram also has a lot of r/jailbait type content and dedicated accounts.


Overall, I'm getting tired of how plagued social media is with obvious OnlyFans funnels when the sites are 13 +. I'm all for sexual freedom and sex work, but keep it on another platform.


It's only a matter of time before it becomes an issue in Congress. Why it hasn't yet is beyond me."
"My daughter was a social media kid in her teens.  A ballet dancer.  Tiktok was very restrictive in what she could post as a minor.  They would flag and remove videos of her in a leotard and tutu if she didn't have pants or leggings on.  She had to send in ID as she aged a couple times to get access to different levels of the app (you have to be 16 to go live, have to be eighteen to monetize).  She never had a thing flagged on instagram.  Tiktok does far more than other platforms (although I think a lot is ignored if you don't have a lot of followers).

Instagram is something else though.  I remember a couple dancers doing shots with implied nudity and they did nothing."
"Government should up the penalties for sites that don't watch closely enough and shut down and report harmful material to the authorities.

Probably not a popular decision among those who value privacies but we need to push those who harm children out to the courthouse."
It'll probably be after a drug overdose and negatively affecting a lot of people around them before that happens. I'm not trying to be negative about it but I feel like that's how it goes with parents grooming their children for internet popularity.
"That is surprising. I've reported a lot of things that are either blatant scams, threats of violence, or even IP infringement and it almost never gets taken down. The automated systems are laughably bad"
What the actual fuck?
"I looked like I was 12 until I was 27.

I'm guessing the app requires age verification in order to get paid.  Tiktok requires a copy of your drivers license to even access those sorts of features if they suspect you are under age.."
"I thought you can only start an onlyfans account with photo Id.
What else is onlyfans to do?"
im waiting for that investigation on all of that incest porn i heard about on pornhub..
"Yeah. Sure, it might be uncomfortable if some people are seeking out porn that fulfills that fantasy, but I don't see how you can ban adults from making porn because of their appearance."
"That makes me feel really weird as a 28 y/o woman who is short and petite and is regularly told that I look young

Like I kind of get what they‚Äôre saying if they were talking about fictional characters, but I‚Äôm a real person, and it makes me feel like they‚Äôre saying anyone that is attracted to me or is in a sexual relationship with me is a secret pedo"
"I barely looked 18 until I was 25. Turns out I was committing statutory rape every time I whacked it in the shower, I guess. Damn, didn't even know.

It's such a stupid fucking line of reasoning. And one that undermines the actual severity of real sexual abuse material, too. I'm not convinced it's even being said in good faith."
"I think the primary concern isn't how young they look, but how young they act. The spokesperson quoted spoke poorly, but I do believe there's still a conversation to be had about 18 year olds making content for creepy older men, paying them to act like 14 year olds. 

Not a question of legality, more one of the content OF wants to allow."
"The book is criticizing pedophiles. The guy grooming the girl is the villain, not a protagonist to sympathize with. 

I‚Äôm mildly alarmed, because if you read it in school, they should‚Äôve taught this?"
"It's a book written to show us how terrible pedophilia is, from the point of view of the pedophile. Brilliant and horrifying."
"The guy kidnaps his 12 year old stepdaughter from summer camp after her mother dies and takes her on a road trip while raping her repeatedly. He also meets another pedophile along the way and they bond over their depravity. In the book, Lolita is a child. She is described as prepubescent and physically and mentally childlike. He just has this fantasy that she is sexual because he's a pedophile. It's disgusting and became a classic that is loved by Hollywood."
Wasn't there also a case where a guy got arrested for a little lupe cd. She actually had to fly to the states to testify that she was actually in her 20s? Was Florida I think.
"If they upload their ID, then upload illegal content, wouldn't it be incredibly easy to find the uploader?"
Remember: It permanently goes away as soon you ban it. That's how we won the war on drugs.
Yeah it's still like the most ethical source of porn tbh
"It's literally being used to traffic and abuse women, are you fucking serious? It's also used to groom underaged women with this whole ""second you turn 18"" BS. 

Wow."
"Let's not pretend than OnlyFans is a charity. It is better for the performers than the traditional industry, but there are still people making money off of them."
"I mean, what is Reddit‚Äôs age verification system for the popular NSFW subreddits that feature self posted content? Click a single button?"
"Reddit had a ‚Äújailbait‚Äù subreddit for a long time. I was pretty young when it was around, glad I never actually saw it. There might be a new one kicking around, but I think they scrubbed the site pretty hard a while back."
"I guarantee you that 90+% of the people downvoting that comment have never consumed OF content in their lives, but rather are irked due to the fact that they respect and support ethical sex workers. 

OF gave many SWers a way to control their own content, rather than having to work with predatory agencies and pimps. People who despise the platform often have some kind of hang up about women being in control of their own sexualities"
"> There used to be a subreddit dedicated to find and report these kind of videos.

There also used to be a subreddit (one of the most popular subreddits on the entire site, in fact) to collect and share these kinds of videos, but Reddit (the company) doesn't like to brag about that for some reason..."
"I remember that subreddit, what happened to it? I can't recall the name but those people were doing a great service."
"How does it even cross someone's mind to look this up? Like... what's the search prompt? ""Preteen yoga practice""?"
GRWM for the all-ages candy rave!
"What's more concerning are the number of *saves* on those posts. There'll be a video with a kid and it'll have like 4x more saves than likes. 

Gods, there really need to be laws about not being able to monetize your child on the internet."
The algo literally serves them up to all horny dudes. Let one stay on your search window for too long and you'll get a half dozen more.
Because members of congress are 87 years old
"I remember Millie Bobby Brown describing to a reporter quite enthusiasticly about Drake hitting her up online for boyfriend advice. It's like, why didn't her parents say anything about not doing that?"
"Totally agree, I was entirely surprised and relieved the page got taken down. I didn't expect anything to be done about it."
"A lot of unreported abuse happens with the parents' knowledge. 

That's why you occasionally see parents so vehemently protecting child abusers - they're either in the know, or willingly in denial (""This guy offered to babysit and pay me for it! Free money, and what could go wrong?"")."
"My friend in college got mistaken for a middle schooler.

Her moms coworker saw her reading a big book at a holiday party and was like 'omg your daughter must be so smart to be reading sucb a book at her age!'

She was 22 at the time."
"I had to grow a beard and hit my late 30s before I stopped getting carded for basically everything. If I shaved now, I‚Äôd be able to pass for late 20s, probably. Even with the beard, people usually assume I‚Äôm 30ish, not knocking on 40. 

That being said, I also wasn‚Äôt small. I‚Äôm 6ft, 200lbs. About the same size as I was at 18, minus some of the muscle, and plus a bit of pudge."
Yeah heard about...
"I'm empathizing with your situation, but I'm also curious where the line is meant to be drawn?"
"I am 5'1 and was mistaken for a middle schooler until my late 30s. Like, I once had a group of 8th graders try to bully me at a playground. In my 30s. I gotta say, crows feet and other obvious signs of middle age made my life a LOT easier.

I remember a tweet about ""guys who date women under 5'4 are pedophiles"" that became the main internet squabble for a couple of days. Like, yeah, I guess I better divorce my 5'6 husband to protect our hobbit-ass kids from him, thanks, internet life coach!"
Jesus fcking christ. I don't think id equate Lolita and petite then
If they fake the ID it could be done
And alcohol
Yeah I guess it's the most ethical but it's not like it's lifted by its ethics. It's better than trafficking rings and abuse at least.
"Of course, but that's no different from Youtubers or streamers or any kind of content that is hosted on something other than its own website."
I'm against it and I judge the consumer harder than I do the producer.  I'm still judging the producer though.
It did when subreddit of the year
I mean that subreddit and others like it were banned by the company years ago.
"The subreddit was discontinued, partly becuz sharing links of that kind of content in public is not exactly a good idea, especially when those kinds of people can simply use it as a free source of video, and also it can be dangerous too."
"Was it inspired by that guy who did the expos√© on the YouTube algorithm funneling you very quickly into a child porn sharing ring based on a few watched videos? 

Here's that expos√©:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O13G5A5w5P0

Basically, the ""people who watched this watched that"" algorithm would funnel you to videos of kids doing mostly innane kid stuff, like dancing or whatever. Pedophiles would tag time stamps for other pedophiles because of a 1 second window of an upskirt and they'd share dark web links to child pornography in the comments. The guy started with a fresh account and within a few videos watched the algorithm was ""in the child porn ring"", and all suggested videos were time-stamped and had links in comments.

It led to a lot of advertisers pulling ads from YouTube, including Disney."
r/elsagate
The jailbait one?
"There is a lot of kids, teens, or parents who might want to watch these exercise videos. The innocent, entirely sincere searches for ""teen yoga practice"" are the reason why other searches aren't flagged immediately."
"There are a few patterns, but for obvious reasons I'm not going to disclose them."
"I tried to report some random reel on IG that was one of those moms pimping out their kid and IG made it bloody impossible to do. And then after that started serving up tons more of that content. I had to block every one that came up until it finally stopped.


So fucking bizarre how these companies can hide behind ""the algorithm."""
No TikTok in the nursing home
"The other issue is how ridiculously low the minimum age to get married is in a lot of states. As long as they have parental permission, literal child marriage is legal. They use it to get around age of consent laws."
"I dated a girl freshman year of college, she was a year older than me and we had people ask if she was my daughter."
">I'm also curious where the line is meant to be drawn?

Somewhere roughly around ""is this person an adult capable of consent?"""
"OK, but then why would it matter if they were required to upload it once or every time they upload?"
Why can‚Äôt they ban ‚Äúwomenarethings‚Äù now? It‚Äôs like the first sub that comes up when you type ‚Äúwomen‚Äù on Reddit
Seems to be entirely because of the silly Reddit API protests that had no effect
now it makes sense why YouTube videos tagged for children don't allow comments.
"That's honestly kind of scary, that an algorithm can do that, and seemingly reliably."
"100% I think that was what I seen from there, I remember reading an article or two at least about that exact thing and afaik the two things were linked in some kind of way"
"I want to say it was something like ""YouTubeWatch"", I know that isn't the name, but it was something that indicated basically they were monitoring YouTube for that kind of inappropriate content (this was years ago)"
"That and not having a single person working in the QC department apparently. I was reporting the same ""send me money and I'll send you more!"" scammer for years after she got my friend"
Very true and that's only the ones we know of
I mean it's how they got around OF's ID system to stop this.
"They could if they cared enough.  But misogyny just isn't as taboo as pedophilia, especially now when there's a statistically significant portion of the population that strongly identifies with misogynist talking points."
"Isn't that just a fetish subreddit? I don't think it'd be a good thing to just start banning all kinds of nsfw, some are as educational as they are niche. If they aren't seriously advocating for harm in the real world then I've of the mind to leave them alone or do my best to ignore them if they aren't my thing"
Isn't that an effect then?
Yes it's so silly how I can't use rif anymore
"Algorithms just respond to engagement. Algorithms don't understand reasoning

Time stamping videos is engagement 

Time stamping videos of home DIY shows the videos have segments people find shareable, for whatever reason (we understand it's because of key DIY techniques)

Time stamping videos of kids dancing shows the videos have segments people find shareable, for whatever reason (we NOW understand what the reason was, and now it's shut down)"
"Right, so refer back to my comment regarding age and appearance and where the line is drawn."
It didn‚Äôt look like a fetish sub to me when I browsed it. No specific themes. Seemed like general corn.
How many countries have to be involved directly and indirectly for this to be a world war? Asking for a friend.

"NK has already counted most of its soldiers as losses. The goal is to provide enough experience in modern warfare for the higher officers to bring home. Bringing home the troops themselves would only be an expenditure.

You should not underestimate the inhumanity of the regimes of both North Korea and Russia."
Genuinely feel bad for these people. I suspect most if not all of them knew nothing about the war because of the extreme censorship. They probably thought they were going to military training in foreign country. Couldn't even say no because chubby Kim might send them to labor camps and couldn't even escape because they didn't want their family to spend the rest of their lives at the camps. These people were put in the shittiest non-negotiable position.
"Problem is even though there were 3000 North Korean troops killed, there are millions more that their leader is willing to send to help Russia. Human life means nothing to men of power, it does not effect them because they are not the ones who pay the price. Lambs to the slaughter, while the rulers sit back and watch in safety."
thanks for captain obvious....actual help would be much more valuable
The russians were recorded burning the dead soldiers faces for some reason. I dont know why they would not want to identify them.
How would South Korea even know this? There is literally massive bounties from Ukraine for a single confirmed North Korean and none have been confirmed at all.
"I too love made up numbers coming from third parties...

"When you have 75 million soldiers from 70 different countries fighting across 3 continents (4 if you count naval battles off the coast of Australia)

"If you need to ask if you‚Äôre in a world war, you‚Äôre not in a world war."

This is more of a super power arms and research testing field with live targets.
Ukraine is a European country and the war acting as a proxy for the Korean War (which never ended) with theaters in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean where both sides have been actively hiring mercenaries globally.
I call it a Proxy World War.
"This is more like the 1930s, so we‚Äôre on our way but not there yet"
"When future history books go over this time period, we are in the section that will be labeled, ""the lead up to world War 3"""
"This isn‚Äôt even close to a world war. Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded by multiple U.S. aligned countries. In Vietnam, the Aussies and South Koreans sent troops alongside the U.S., and there‚Äôs evidence that Soviet pilots actually flew sorties in North Vietnamese marked planes."
"The countries involved have to *declare* war.

Which they are not, because as soon as they do, a number of disadvantageous things happen for their leadership.

Additionally, nobody wants to declare war because some countries including North Korea and Russia have openly stated that if war is declared, they will immediately and automatically launch nukes."
Most men who fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War were too poor to even own slaves.
Rich men that know each other send young men that don‚Äôt know each other to kill each other.
"They're all a loss. Once you leave NK, you can never go back again  for life. They have been exposed to the world they were never to have known about.

These kids left two, maybe three generations behind, likely at least one in front, and the nation will never let them return knowing to outside world. 

It was decided from day one they would never see their families ever again."
Not to mention the soldiers from North Korea probably didn't have a choice.
"Yes. I have no quarrel with the people of NK , Ukraine, or Russia. I‚Äôve never even met them."
At some point Putin was a little baby too. So what?
"While I understand the sentiment behind your comment, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúman, if only this war wasn‚Äôt inevitable so we could avoid all this death‚Äù situation. 

I can‚Äôt speak to the NK soldiers, but every single Russian soldier is a volunteer, not a conscript. So they chose money to go invade and kill their neighbors. If they don‚Äôt want to die, they could always try to overthrow their short, fat despots instead and improve the lives of their countrymen rather than killing people who are trying to prevent the genocide of their country"
"Russia has spent years hiding behind their dead, NK will never so much as admit how many were lost to war. 

Considering the whole country is starving to death and sucking juice out of roots, they are the lucky ones."
"Yeah, I'm with you. These NK soldiers with no previous combat experience, forced into an unfamiliar environment with no protection from drones, are probably dominating the battle-hardened, drone-using master Ukrainians on their home turf."
"Kinda sad that we are viewing the death toll, easily in the hundreds of thousands and possibly in the millions as entertainment. I cannot stand the governments of Russia and North Korea and can barely tolerate the US government, but it isn't the elites who die, but poor young men who have no political power."
Don‚Äôt forget Asia and Northern Africa.
As a Canadian im not sure if i should be thrilled or not to be left out
Syria was a theater in the larger conflict to say nothing of UAF and Russian government-backed PMCs fighting in the West African crises.
Don't forget the Cubans
The numbers for people dead in the current global conflict situation are greatly underreported.
"That is incorrect and those things begin during war, not before."
World proxy war 1
">They would need to actually fight though

>not just send troops and supplies

That's basically what fighting is lol what? You need the countries to verbally acknowledge they're in the war for them to be considered a participant?

Let's not pretend that the moment your troops are dying on the battlefield you aren't part of the war"
"This is effectively how WW2 started, western countries gave aid to the defender, appeasement to the attacker and eventually it bubbled up when a red line was crossed.¬†"
"They were in the mindset that, they too! Can own slaves, one day. People today with that mindset think, they too! Can be a billionaire, one day."
"I truthfully don't know why you have been downvoted. This is a pretty common fact. Most rebels were unable to afford slaves. Doesn't mean they didn't want them, just that they couldn't afford them."
"they were fighting for 'State rights"", and that is how they sold it to the poors."
"Yeah, I feel bad for them. Any ‚Äúchoice‚Äù they had was probably along the lines of ‚Äúgo or die‚Äù."
No soldiers have a choice.

"If you think every single person on the opposing side is a cold blooded monster, and every single person om your side is a morally just hero, you are consuming too much propaganda.




Are the Ukrainians the ones in the right, just defending themselves? Sure, but be careful you don't forget the human element, and the human cost, on both sides of the conflict caused by corrupt leaders"
You feel the same way about american soldiers in Afghanistan? All volunteers too.
Wait what? Russia has conscription.
"""I can‚Äôt speak to the NK soldiers,¬†""

North Korea has obligatory military service, and a system where you'd probably be killed if you refused to go."
"> volunteer

""volunteer""  

Russia may be a case in learned helplessness where the government bent over backwards to shove conscripts into the warzone 'legally', but DPRK troops have the added condition of that if they don't, their families will be tortured to death"
"Sure, but with that level of empathy you can even feel bad for Nazis.

In the very least, the Russians are easier to hate because they're inexcusably educated for their level of government support. Sure, it's the illiterate bumpkins being sent, but it's pretty wild how pro-war educated Russians are.

I worked with a few Westernized Russians in my last two consulting firms, all three with PhDs or post-docs and the last 6-10y of their life spent in the US, and they viewed this war as self defense, and the US' support as ""world police"" behavior and meddling.

No sense of accountability, and they blamed the US for creating the war and inventing a fake identity for Ukraine, which they compared to Texans trying to leave the US or Quebecois trying to escape Canada üòë"
Well North Korea counts.
Russia and N Korea are in Asia‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre americas top hat anyway so you follow suit too.
Shhh shh shhhh if anyone asks we‚Äôre busy fighting Mordor.
"Yes, that seems closer to the definition of total war, although not quite."
I was going to argue with your ‚Äú1‚Äù there but maybe that is accurate it‚Äôs just been one long world proxy war since ancient times.¬†
Okay then why isn't Spanish civil war considered start of the world war? Because sending troops and supplies is obviously vastly different from waging war yourself. Think for a bit pls.
"It's a proxy war.¬†


No different than the Korean War where Chinese troops fought American's, or Vietnam who were getting aid from communist countries.


The United States and or Russia would have to declare war against one another, or another NATO country.¬†


There would need to be a large scale attack, akin to Pearl Harbor, or the invasion of a NATO country for WW3.


WW2 is the most devastating conflict in human history. Nobody wants to repeat it.¬†"
"I don't think allies gave any help to czechoslovakia and austria, dont think they helped spain too."
"I don't understand either. One guy even took it as I'm ""pro-slavery"" when that's not the case at all. 

I'm trying to show with my statement how ridiculous it was for Confederate soldiers to lose their lives for a cause, that at the time, most couldn't even participate in."
"I think they were instead implying that the United States has a long history of attempting to use fantasies of wealth and status to rally the poor to their cause, which was a central aspect of maintaining racial dominion in the south. 

Maybe next time inquire about intent before going off on a long self righteous educational rant that OP more than likely is already aware of. 

Extremely reddit behavior tbh"
"Well you wrote all this for nothing, because that's not what I was trying to say at all. 

I was trying to show how wasteful and unnecessary it was that many soldiers fighting for the Confederacy couldn't even own slaves, losing their lives over nothing. 

I also don't believe General Lee was a good general, both from a tactical standpoint and the he wasn't fighting for slavery, but fighting for his home state of Virginia. He was fighting for slavery."

"They do have conscription but in general they only send contract soldiers to Ukraine. There have been exceptions, notably the Russians in the early Kursk incursion were mainly conscripts. [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/europe/russia-putin-war-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html)"
"If you sent your own citizens to fight and die on a battlefield, you're a participant in that war.  I don't care what war it is"

Well fighting in Vietnam continued after Japan surrendered and ended 1975 involving countries from three different continent.
"I know about the different interpretations, personally I see Japanese-Chinese war as a separate conflict which got merged into the world war. And of course I could see ww1 and ww2 being merged into one conflict separated by a truce.  
But yeah, supporting someone in a war is still completley different than going to war yourself, the sheer scale is just something entirerly different."
I'm afraid war is a bit more complicated than that
"You're free to ignore reality and nuance as much as you want, not my problem."

There's a difference between being a ""main player"" like Russia and Ukraine or sending supplies and military intelligence like the US or soldiers like North Korea, but let's not pretend for a second that this is exclusively between Russia and Ukraine.  It's bigger than that

We let countries off the hook for fighting proxy wars far too often"

Ron Desantis is probably even now trying to figure out how to put a stop to this. Assuming he knows.
"> But a common complaint from students and parents is that the instruction seems limited to heroic figures like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks and rarely extends beyond each February‚Äôs¬†[Black History Month] 

In my city on the pacific west coast, there are a lot of communities that do the same, create methods, clubs for ethnic groups to learn more about their culture, that they wont get from the school system.

In SF, Chinese kids have gone to Chinese school to learn language and culture, and this goes all the way back to the 1950's.

Jewish celebrate their heritage, and educate the next generation through their bar mitzvahs and ... more

I'm sure there are other examples. I hope this movement for the African American population of ... America... spreads, and we can find African American Sunday Schools across the US."
"I grew up in Mississippi. Left there as soon as I could (in the 90s). In school we had the required Mississippi history lessons where ‚Äúslavery was bad mmkay‚Äù and was followed by a whole slew of justifications and lies. 

‚ÄúA slave cost as much as a BMW today. You wouldn‚Äôt beat your BMW with a hammer if the tire lost pressure. Why would you beat a slave if they didn‚Äôt pick enough cotton? They lived good lives. We all have to work. They worked and got free room and board.‚Äù

During the George Floyd mess, I listened to a bunch of black leaders who said, ‚Äúwe just want people to educate themselves.‚Äù Realizing I never had, I picked up the book [The Half Has Never Been Told](https://a.co/d/hV09SKg) and was blown away by the lies told to me in my youth. 

It‚Äôs also much more complicated than ‚ÄúSouth bad North good.‚Äù The entire country, North and South, was guilty. The South for having the slaves, and the North for knowingly maintaining the high demand for the slave products. 

The biggest takeaway for me was this: learning history is the greatest gift you can give to the future. Be wary of anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to know the truth of the past and tells lies about it."
"My African American studies professor in college taught the best lesson ever: African American History is American History, trying to separate the two dishonors both. Just learn American History, they're intertwined."
Kids should be forced to learn about the Harlem Hell Fighters of WW1. Those guys were the very best of the best and America still treated them like shit. It's an absolute disgrace and I think everyone should know about it.
Bit of a sensationalist title no? The teacher contracted to the library to teach this on Saturdays and the only student seems to be her 12 year old daughter telling her classmates to come? Doesn't sound like she's got a choice whether or not she goes lol. I presume the people going aren't necessarily going to learn about Black History but are probably using it as a sort of child care?
This is awesome.  These kids are giving DeSantis et al the finger.  And I love it.
"‚ÄúGiving up Saturdays,‚Äù is a weird way to say, ‚Äúutilizing their time‚Äù."
"Is this not normal? The article talks about how church groups in Florida as well as museums are teaching African American history. Why is that a news story? Is it because it's Florida? 

Maybe our country is too big and diverse sometimes, because learning about history through discussion groups, museums, etc. seems so normal to me as someone from the NYC area. 

Like regardless of how trashy the Florida education system is it's still a great thing to learn about history on your own. A public school curriculum can only cover so much regardless of the state."
Good for them. Sorry that‚Äôs the path they‚Äôre having to take though. But way to take a stand!
Can they do this for lawmakers and make it mandatory?
"They shouldn't have to do this, but good on them.

Makes me sad what we take away from kids because their parents and adults around them are abject failures at life."
Don't blame this on the teachers.
"To learn more about the history of Florida, go to school somewhere else."
When 3 students do this it isn't considered a trend...
Black history in the US? Isn't that just US history?
Alternate title: Museum is open Saturday and is moderately popular
"some students do this for bible school, but I dont see that shocking the world"
I gave up Saturdays to study Biology. And even more Saturdays before that.
Black history is history. Not teaching it means you aren‚Äôt teaching history.
"All learning is good.  

That said as someone that went through high school in Miami-Dade, I learned more about black history than non-black history. 

All the sections on slavery and civil rights were highlighted over things like the revolutionary war. 

Though again, if kids are going to museums on Saturday: good."
DeSantis is such a waste.
I'm curious how warped the new lessons are.
I love this so much. I‚Äôd sign up as an adult.
Fuck DeSantis and all those that try to hide history.
Too bad the holocaust seems to be kept out of mention - I feel adults need a reminder of all the things people are capable of
"Greek school is forced to move to Saturday afternoon, and Sunday school moves to Sunday afternoon to accommodate."
"Private individuals once again stepping in to do what the government won't. And if people don't want to learn black history, they don't have to."
"Other than people of color shouldn't need to resort to this, is there a genuine argument against this material being taught and it shouldn't be allowed? Also, what are anyone's thought on whether or not it would be all right if people of color, like Hispanics and Asians, publicized these sorts of informal classes and invited students to participate on a social media sites like Nextdoor or even TikTok --or whatever replaces it if it gets banned?"
I wonder if people would protest against Saturday school
"When the elections happened, the first thing I did was go buy books about real history. Books about the massacre in Tulsa. Books about indigenous people. Anything that wasn‚Äôt white washed. I don‚Äôt know if my kids will read them, I‚Äôm not going to push it. But someday maybe someone will pick one up and read about what really happened."
"Luckily learning is easier to come by today with YouTube, internet and every imaginable source of free and paid sources. What‚Äôs important to impart is curiosity and exploring ideas, and coming to one‚Äôs own conclusions.

I have a lot of hope for the younger generation. They are more informed and have more access to to varying views and sources than any generation before them. I think they‚Äôll surprise us."
"I've never met anyone who took an african american history class and came out a Republican. And that's not the point of the class at all, its just modern day politics start to look very similar to what you read and researched. Republicans kill science classes because it makes their religiousness look silly, of course they'll kill classes that literally create life long opposition voters."
On one hand it is pretty uplifting that students are interested in learning about history outside of school and how they relate to it. On the other hand it's pretty awful that they have to show initiative to learn about their own history because their schools don't teach it to them.
I am confused why they refuse to teach *american history* in US schools.
r/OrphanCrushingMachine
Who do you think their parents voted for?
"Teaching on Saturday or Sunday will be made illegal, except for Sunday School at white Christian churches."
Good. I've recently said any of these so called bans cannot stand up to personal action.
They‚Äôll try to outlaw these.
Don't teach?  You mean won't teach.
This is the first thing that‚Äôs made me want to be a teacher in 20 years.
"ah well this is very nice. but the problem is that conservatives' policy of making America Dumb Again, it works.  (re: Florida destroying public education, destroying African American history lessons).

So the bulk of Florida will remain in the dark and believe whatever Desantis and conservatives want them to believe.  Slaves were well treated, compensated, etc. 

There will always be that top chunk of people that are in the know and want to educate themselves and be better people, but unfortunately, most Americans, and I suspect people in general (human nature) is that the rest of the population doesn't care and just wants to have that nice happy tummy, a full tank of gas, and a big screen tv to watch their favorite sports team."
I honestly doubt this lmao. Maybe 10 students lol
"It's sad, but you do what you have to. I grew up with ABC, who went to Chinese school to learn how to write the language and more about the culture, etc."
"We‚Äôre gonna outlaw learning and reading in Florida, aren‚Äôt we?!!"
You cannot adequately teach Black history without teaching socialism. Obviously not every black revolutionary was a socialist‚Ä¶ but too damn many of them were to ignore the blatant disregard for honest history. But not a peep of this is mentioned.
"~~don‚Äôt~~ **won‚Äôt** teach.

There‚Äôs a difference"
Crazy! Who would have thought Florida would become that state
Ron Desantis declares Saturdays no longer days.
where is the secret (kkk) police at!?!? - ron desantis and conservatives probably
"Can't wait for major companies and universities stop hiring and accepting Florida 'graduates'. Well, without requiring them to take remedial courses. Who wants uneducated freak Florida kids lurking around?"
"Downvote bombing, nice, buncha fucking racists."
This is giving Dumbledore‚Äôs army
"Good for them! That environment for learning will hopefully help to take those kids farther in life; we need to make sure the next generation is educated to learn how hard their rights were fought for and that the fight (just like racism) is never truly over. Not that bullshit sanitized crap where they act like if MLK (for example) was alive today, that they ACTUALLY wouldn't want him shot again. Can you even imagine if John Lewis, or Bayard Rustin, or Claudette Colvin were currently a living and active BLM member, or part of the modern voting rights movement how they would be treated them? Even the so-called ""moderate  republicans"" would be calling to jail them for standing up for their rights. Just look at how they treat activists today and it is clear. The fight for your rights is never over, don't get complacent because the moment you do they will take them away again. Again good on these kids, and good on these parents for hopefully encouraging this. I saw a lot of good history being mentioned in the curriculum laid out for this, but I also hope they cover topics such as modern voter suppression, gerrymandering, and useful organizing tactics. Giving young people the tools to fight to preserve their rights and get active, alongside teaching them the history of it, would hopefully be really empowering for a lot of people."
"This is how religions get started, so that's interesting."
Good for all 3 of them.
Actually reading this shows something entirely different. I don‚Äôt believe shit Reddit says and for good reason.
That's great and makes a lot of sense. You can spend as much of your free time learning history or learning about other cultures as you want!
"So, how does teaching of ""black history"" (to use the article's term) in Florida compare to how it's taught in other states?  Is there any evidence to suggest that Florida's teaching is deficient compared to them?"
I'm confused. Why would you have to give up saturdayS to learn about peanut butter?
This is performative. Just educate yourself on it at home. There's a shitload of resources. It's not like this is an overly complex subject that you will need tutoring on.
"If it's all voluntary, more power to them. However, be it any subject, when do kids ever do that? I feel like it's just zealous parents pushing their wills on their unenthusiastic kids as wish fulfillment."
"Didn't I just read that they're banning teenagers from social media in FL? It might be unrelated, but I figure the Internet would follow shortly after"
‚Ä¶..How to read.
He‚Äôs probably working with PragerU to support the publication of more shit about how Black Slaves happily learned useful skills and how Native Americans should be thankful that they weren‚Äôt completely wiped out (in spite of the determined efforts by the Whites).
watch DeSantis try to make school 6 days a week now
Remove Saturdays! 6 day week people
Saturdays are now part of the liberal agenda.
"‚ÄúThe mere idea of it. You are going to give me the shortest month in a year? And you are going to celebrate ‚Äòmy‚Äô history?! This whole idea makes my teeth itch. It‚Äôs not right.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy history is American history. It‚Äôs the one thing in this world I am interested in, beyond making money, having a good time and getting enough sleep.‚Äù

Black History month is stupid and pandering."
Yeah i used to go to a Jewish after school program with all the other Jews from school to learn about the Jewish lens and our culture. They also prepared us for our bar mitzvah and taught us about trope
"My dad went to Chinese school when he was a kid in the SF Bay Area. That was back during WWII. They didn't really learn about the history of Chinese people in this country, though. We don't learn about that, these days. I had to learn from a Native American visiting the Asian American sub how Chinese workers, building the railroad expansion during the 19th century, in places like Wyoming, were sometimes paid with a bullet and a place in a mass grave instead of the cash they were promised. Native Americans know where the bodies are buried."
"Polish schools are very common in different countries with a Polish diaspora. In the USA, they tend to be attached to Catholic churches, while in Europe they are more secular and run by Poles instead of priests. Most Polish families who want their kids to speak the language will send their kids to them on Saturdays, otherwise the language disappears really quickly (even when both parents speak it)."
"This exists in the Black community, they're called Freedom Schools. They have been around since the 60s I believe :)"
The problem with that is that it is just as important for white students to learn black history.¬†
"I've seen Ukrainian and Russian Saturday schools as well as summer camps. I also knew a Vietnamese girl who went to a Vietnamese Saturday school too. 

And near me a local black community organization made a scouting group (like Girl or Boy Scouts but separated by age, not gender, and there's not separate unaffiliated troops) for black kids to spend time with each other and learn about their culture. 

It's not new at all. I think it's the best people can realistically hope for at this point. Obviously we should improve how we teach black history but that's not likely to happen in a widespread way anytime soon. And even with curriculum changes, there's never a guarantee that it'll actually be taught well across the board if individual teachers don't care enough to educate themselves and teach it right."
"The only problem is that everybody needs to learn everybody‚Äôs history. If we‚Äôre all supposed to share this place‚Ä¶ In some relative harmony. Respectfully. With compassionate curiosity instead of total ignorance.

Schools are responsible for teaching kids how to become good citizens (along with other caregivers). 

Understanding cultural differences (and how to navigate them without irrational blame or resentment) is essential to building multicultural communities."
The problem is though that while not everyone needs to learn how to read Hebrew (like your Jewish kids example) black history IS U.S. history and everyone should learn it not just black kids
">In SF, Chinese kids have gone to Chinese school to learn language and culture, and this goes all the way back to the 1950's.

That's not exclusively a Chinese thing, nor even a San Francisco thing, Chicago had them too, in a wide variety of languages/cultures that aren't Chinese"
Hell in the northeast i was raised roman cahtolic and had weekly ‚Äúclasses‚Äù from my first communion to my confirmation. Ive left now but yeah this is a very normal practice for most cultures and i support it wholly.
"What makes me angry as a taxpayer is this isn‚Äôt taught to everyone regardless of racist relatives. My mom has always been liberal but we were still racist (not on purpose) until the internet helped us to expand our horizons.

"It makes sense, how could schools in the US be expected to teach about every single culture that makes up the population?

A huge part of US population has German roots, yet most Americans can‚Äôt name a single German that was born before Adolf Hitler and not many after that.

Should there be weekend classes for German history?"
would have loved this for south american history! getting to choose to take a south american history class in college was so cool (even though it didnt count towards my credits :( )
"I had a supervisor years ago tell me about Emmit Till.  I have never heard about his story being brought up in the south and yes I'm white.  He also shared with me the story of what happened in Rosewood, Florida in 1923.  And those were just a couple of starters.  He didn't have bitterness when he shared, he just asked if I knew and when I didn't, he asked if he could share.

Our country definitely has a lot of things it shouldn't be proud of in its past.  My heart was breaking when I read about what all went on in these stories and some others similar in nature.

I agree with you.  History should be shared in its unaltered, unabridged form for all to learn the lessons from it so we or future generations don't repeat it."
"Then Florida schools are no longer teaching American history. That's bad.

And these kids are going to school on saturday to learn American history, because their schools don't teach it.

It just so happens those schools tend to not teach parts of American history that make white americans of some period look bad. Weird, isn't it?"
i think the problem is that until the Civil Rights era scholars dismissed the experiences of Blacks (and other minorities) because they were not WASPs & didn't contribute to the America experience as expressed through Toqueville and even more recent historians like Bailyn & Lipset.
That does not work now when repubs are actively rewriting and blocking true history from being told to cover up Americas ugly past
"> African American History is American History,

then there‚Äôs no need for a black history month then"
This is immediately what I expected when I read the title lmao
"Do they teach ‚Äúblack history‚Äù or ‚Äúconservative approved black history‚Äù?


Do they teach MLK a guy who just peacefully marched, said everyone should be treated equally then everyone just agreed racism was over? Or do they accurately teach he was a radical socialist who was maliciously targeted by the government and widely unpopular by white Americans at the time? 

Etc etc."
"New Florida standards teach students that some Black people benefited from slavery because it taught useful skills

Between this and Prager U, people who don't know any better are cooked."
"Did you just skim past the part that says ""after 30 years, families no longer trust the state's education system"" part? Reading comprehension is a thing."
They teach that the civil war was about civil rights and that black people learned valuable life skills and benefited from slavery.
"Considering who the governor is and his political alignment, I‚Äôd bet money it is a revisionist version. You know, the black history where is was good we kidnapped them because they ended up in America where they had new opportunities, and learned ‚Äòskills‚Äô working in the fields."
"I don't know if that's nearly as clear as you seem to think it is, hoss."
They‚Äôre also welcome to use their Saturdays learning quantum computing their standard curriculum doesn‚Äôt offer in other unimportant news.
"They teach state approved Black history, which in Florida is likely to be slanted or straight up false.  

Think about how people who lived in the South have reported learning about The War of Northern Aggression, or the Texas history books that called slaves ""immigrants""."
You cannot be this dumb. You must be trolling. Try being less obvious next time.
Yep. Headline is stupid bate. They're not allowed to teach critical race theory which isn't even normally taught in grade school. It's a bunch of fluff. I'm a Kamala voter and I know this. I wish the left wasn't so dramatic and cringey all the time. No one will take us seriously when we're just as big of crybabies as the Trumpers are.
"It‚Äôs the highly sanitized ‚Äúslaves were happy‚Äù stuff. Nothing about slaves running away, being sold, being whipped, etc."
"They ""teach"" Black History, meaning they gloss over a lot of it because it makes them feel guilty. Meaning they'll go over King's I Have A Dream Speech, but not mention the Tulsa Race Massacre. Hell with this being Florida they might even go further and say that slaves like being slaves."
Republicans been trying to push that Skavery was good fir the African Americans

"Over the years, I have looked deeply into the slave history of American history. John Newton wrote a very interesting piece titled ""Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade"", which can be read here: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68056/68056-h/68056-h.htm John Newton actually worked as a ship hand on the very boats that brought the slaves over. 30 years after retiring, he reflected upon all that had happened and deeply regretted the entire ordeal. He goes into detail about how the slave traders calculated down to the penny whether it would be cheaper to house and feed their slaves to extend their lives or to simply buy a new one. The conclusion was to work them to the bone, which lasted about 9 years, then buy a new one after they died. He also tells of a story of how a ship mate threw a crying baby overboard because he wanted to sleep.

Everything the slaves went through was horrible, and conservatives love to cover it up. They will say things like ""liberals are the ones who keep making everything about race; they keep bringing it up"", and promoting this idea that black people don't need help and are on the same footing - that helping them out in modern times with things like affirmative action and DEI is insulting somehow because ""we all are playing on the same level - they don't need handouts"". It completely overlooks things like generational wealth inequality where $30,000 houses back then now go for $300,000 now if they're in a white neighborhood, but only for $40,000 if they're in a black neighborhood. It overlooks the fact that black neighborhoods are policed more and that police have a habit of killing a lot of innocent black people. It overlooks the examples we've seen of applicants with white names being hired more frequently over applicants with black names. Conservatives want to deny that there is a difference - they want to hide black history from you so you're ignorant - all to prop up their racist, white voting base that keeps them in power.

Reading about the origins of black history month is another interesting bit. Conservatives like to ask, ""well why isn't there a white history month, huh?!?!?!"" and like to repeat that clip of Morgan Freeman saying he doesn't want a black history month because it's embarrassing to him. All of this ignores how black history month all came about. The man who started it recognized that the history of the Navajo, Cherokee, Dakota, Choctaw, Western Apache, Pawnee, [etc] Indian peoples' history was quickly being lost. To avoid a repeat of this problem with African American history, he made efforts to gather notes from slaves, stories, transactions, and much more to keep some kind of paper trail. That is probably the only reason we know anything about black history today. It goes without saying that for being a black man himself, it is one of the most ignorant things for Morgan Freeman to have shunned black history month; that is exactly the kind of black man the conservatives are hoping to promote."
They won't
"I might be biased as a German, but the important aspect for me is that most of the people who supported or tolerated the holocaust back then would look and sound just like your neighbors today. There was no monster that emerged from under the bed. We all were that monster. All it took was shitty leadership, who, unfortunately, had the talent to tell people just what they needed to hear. They wanted leadership out of economic hardship, they wanted to feel relevant again and they needed someone to hate. Sound familiar?"

"I feel like this take on Mr. Freeman‚Äôs opinion is misleading.  He didn‚Äôt want there to have to be a Black History Month because he believed that what is known as ‚ÄúBlack History‚Äù should be taught in every American History class to expand our understanding of how we got to where we are and make our country unified.

He was not saying that black history should not be taught, he was saying it shouldn‚Äôt be distinguished as something outside of American History."

"This. There's a difference between the history of a group in America and the history of an group. If we're teaching American history, there should be honest segments on all Americans.

excellent point. the point of history is not just to celebrate our victories but more importantly learn from our mistakes and make sure it can never happen again.
I had to take an ethnic studies class as part of the gen ed requirement for my degree. I opted to take Chicano history. I figured I may as well use the opportunity to learn about a culture that gets no attention in our school curriculum. You can learn these things as a white person but it may take seeking the opportunities out rather than waiting for the Ron DeSantises of the world to have a change of heart.
"I hate the term ""black history"" because it is unnecessarily others part of American history.  

From even colonial days, chattel slavery of Africans shaped the US.  Success of the northern abolitionist movement eliminated slavery (mostly) in the north before the civil war, but also shaped southern attitudes.   This, and other fears (such as the success of the Haitian revolution) lead directly to the American civil war.  Not to mention the violent conflicts before that were caused, at least in part, by slavery (Texas, Kansas, etc).

Then there's the reconstruction and afterwards the rise of Jim Crow and the disenfranchisement of a large class of people.  There's the three Klans, and the rise of the civil rights movement.

That's all American history, and just the 10,000 foot view of the importance of various groups of people in our history.  I'm speaking in broad strokes, not even drilling down to individuals.

The cynical side of me thinks this is purposely othered because those with power don't want these stories to be told.  They'd rather you not hear about people crossing ethnic lines to support rights of others.  They'd rather you not hear how those in power used various tricks to remove the rights of people.  They'd rather you not know that those in power would even go to war to preserve their power, drumming up a false nationalism, to make those not in power to act against their interests.  They'd rather you not know how racism was used to manipulate groups.  And many of them would prefer that you think American had a golden age."
"The real problem is ""black history"" in general. Even the people who want others to learn about it, separate black history from white history or whatever, which is exactly what the ones trying to stop it want you to do.


People should learn relevant and important history. Slavery and racism is a huge part of US history (and of the current day). ""Black history"" is crazy to begin with since it seems that even when it's taught, it's done so starting from *after* people were forced to have their African cultural heritage erased and replaced with whatever slave owners saw fit."
"I think it's more to do with families/students caring to learn it.

When people in charge deem something important to *them* it's added to the curriculum. It's not that not everyone needs to learn Hebrew, but that not enough people in power see it as important to learn. 

Some states see it necessary that all graduates speak a foreign language, and it becomes a requirement that everyone needs to do. Some states/districts decided that every graduate learns an instrument. Is it needed? People in power decided that yes, so it is. 

When individuals see a need for something for their students to learn that the people in power do not, you get extracurricular Saturday schools. There is nothing *bad* about Saturday black history schools. I'm sure they get to teach way more in depth all of the black history, more than any regular public school could ever do, no matter where, simply because this is the only focus they have. White students can also attend them, so if their families care to enroll them, it's there."

"sacramento is just 90 minutes from SF and you can stumble across some casual racism, naivet√© pretty easily there."
"Really, Americans should be able to name at least a few Germans born before Hitler.

Kaiser Wilhelm II and Albert Einstein were both Germans who were born before Hitler.  The former was a head of state in the first World War.  The later was a very notable physicist who emigrated to the US.

Just because someone isn't American doesn't mean it's not relevant to a good education.  One probably should know names like Marx, Lenin and Mao, since all have shaped the world.  As well as events of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the European colonization and decolonization of Africa."

"If you're serious then you can't learn ""white culture "". However most cities have cultural associations for European ethnic groups. E.g. Irish, Ukranian, Italian. Those places definitely are places to learn about ""white culture ""."
It's so embarrassing that I learned about Rosewood from a Ving Rhames movie. Just like many Americans learned about Tulsa from HBO's Watchmen series.
"From the article:

"Honest question, how many Americans are taught about [incidents like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre)? Cos in NZ when I was growing up we were taught *some* of the bad side of our history but not the real sordid details."
"It doesn't look like the lesson plan in question says anything about slaves benefitting from slavery. It could just as easily mean slaves benefitting from skills *in spite* of slavery, rather than because of it."
"The actual wording from Florida's State Academic Standards:

work, painting, carpentry, tailoring, domestic service, blacksmithing,
transportation).
Benchmark Clarifications:
Clarification 1: Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be
applied for their personal benefit.

I don't see anything there that says they benefited from slavery. It does say they benefited from skills they learned. 
Are you saying some slaves didn't become successful because of  trades or skills they learned while in slavery?"
You can read Florida‚Äôs state academic standards the the article cites [here.](https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf) It seems to be a pretty normal teaching of black history and covers things that Reddit likes to say is glossed over in school like the Tulsa race massacre.

My sister went to an HBCU and I didn't. The difference between what she knows about Black history and what I know is ridiculous.  I didn't hear about Juneteenth until 2020.
What the hell are you even talking about?
"It‚Äôs a miracle there were more revolts like in Haiti considering the life expectancy was so low, what did they have to lose? The history of using the church to convince the enslaved it was their duty according to the Bible is also maddening to realize. 

We need similar history like this in Texas. It‚Äôs largely glossed over in the years spent learning Texas history that the truth behind independence from Mexico was slavery. The white settlers with Austin and co largely came to Texas out of fear that the U.S. would make it illegal. Mexico was actually progressive and against slavery and for equality since so many of its citizens were mixed race as so many indigenous women had children by Spanish soldiers."

"When someone reads from the Torah, they often sing it. The trope is kind of like ""sheet music"" and tells the reader how to sing it; it's written in symbols around the word, much like punctuation (or like how vowels are written in Hebrew)."
"Trope/Trup are the cantillation marks which guide how to traditionally chant the Torah, which is the centerpiece of the bar mitzvah ceremony. 

The torah has no punctuation in it so Trup actually serves as sort of musical form of punctuation."

What people in the article are complaining about is that major elements of civil rights struggle and the truth of the brutality that civil rights groups faced so recently that many of the kids who had rocks thrown at them for going to integrated schools are still alive.. And  many of the people who threw rocks at those children are still alive too... That's not being taught."
"Parks is often portrayed as just a random woman who decided not to change seats on a bus one day, rather than a life long radical and community leader who had spent the better part of a year planning a bus boycott and how to launch it."
"I mean if you do that then you have drop something like the Dust Bowl or Japanese american internment.

I grew up in the Midwest, but in my experience it was only the main, surface, talking points like MLK Jr and Rosa Parks. Japanese internment camp was discussed, but most of our history topics are talked about in a day. Looking back, I think we spent more time on either state history and just like Columbus. Middle and high school does world history where I grew up. Like maybe most places, you didn‚Äôt learn much in depth until college or doing your own research.

Edit to add, the Atlantic slave trade was discussed in more details, perhaps a whole month in elementary school, and then discussed further throughout middle and high school possibly for some schools."

"You are not this dumb. You are clearly aware that this absurd ""point"" that slaves forced to labor also had to learn how to do that labor is being included for the same reason that people are offended it is included - to try to coyly imply that slavery had ""upsides"" and thereby imply it wasn't ENTIRELY a bad thing overall. It's lazy propaganda.

That is why the state only started insisting teachers make a point of this once they started looking to make white people feel less bad in history class. ""Slavery was kinda good for slaves actually when you think about it"" has been a repeated propaganda lie since long before the civil war. This is just the latest incarnation of it and no one is falling for it. Some people are pretending to fall for it, but no one actually is."

Benchmark Clarifications: Clarification 1: Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.*

So, keep in mind they won't cover Critical Race Theory, the history they do teach covers multiple instances of slavery across cultures in what, IMHO, is a means to muddy the subject of slavery as it applies to the United States. In other words, some Prager U shit. 

I don't mind you trying to defend what they're doing, but I do mind you failing to understand the difference in what these people are saying vs. what the school says they are going to supply. I say it this way because I sincerely wonder if they'll manage to even get to what they list. There is a lot of Florida history, specific to the Florida they live in, that these people don't know and aren't taught. They don't know and aren't taught it because white people don't want to feel bad. 

The above listed lesson is also an attempt to not feel bad. ""Hey, yeah, your ancestors were enslaved, but they managed to learn life skills because we forced them to work at them if they wanted to live. So you're welcome."" Combine that with their ""Slavery didn't just happen to Black people. Get over it"" lessons, and you have a narrative that manages to teach but not one that educates."

> Even in districts that have staff dedicated to teaching Black history, some teachers are afraid of violating state law, according to Brian Knowles, who oversees African American, Holocaust and Latino studies for the Palm Beach County school district.

>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many other districts and so many kids that we‚Äôre missing because we‚Äôre tiptoeing around what is essentially American history,‚Äù Knowles said.

>Frustration over the restrictions that teachers face pushed Renee O‚ÄôConnor to take a sabbatical last year from her job teaching Black history at Miami Norland Senior High School in the majority-Black city of Miami Gardens. Now, she is back in the classroom, but she also has been helping community groups develop their own Black history programs outside of the public school system.

Lets go further, and look at what their standards have changed https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/floridas-new-african-american-history-standards-whats-behind-the-backlash/2023/07

> For example, the earlier version asked students to evaluate the contributions of African American individuals. The new standards now ask students to simply identify African American individuals. And there are now gaps in terms of standards focusing on ancient African civilizations outside of the context of slavery.

---

> Topics such as the system of government in Egypt or how North Africans went to Spain and developed the first set of universities are not present, even as state law requires instruction on the ‚Äúhistory of African peoples before the political conflicts that led to the development of slavery,‚Äù Coggins said.

---

> In a statement posted online related to this standard, two of the standards authors said ‚Äúthe intent of this particular benchmark clarification is to show that some slaves developed highly specialized trades from which they benefitted.‚Äù

>The statement, posted July 20, a day after the state board approved the standards, goes on to list examples of individuals, nearly half of whom some scholars pointed out were either never enslaved nor gained skills through their enslavement, the Tampa Bay Times reported.


So yes, republicans specifically in florida are rolling back how we teach black history."
Look at all of those edits. You're really showing them that you don't care about them!
"Does that mean he‚Äôs not allowed to point it out? There‚Äôs an obvious truth to what he‚Äôs saying. They want to make America dumb by banning books, forcing religion, and everything in between to make the population easier to control. Just think about all the different ways Trump contradicts himself but it doesn‚Äôt matter cause his cult eats it up.

Besides, he didn‚Äôt exactly excuse himself either. He said it‚Äôs probably human nature."
"Oh! Well , the way you worded it made it seem like you dislike people studying stuff about their history."
"Considerably more common, too. Smart evil people succeed because dumb decent people - being far more common - like to underestimate them and downplay the threat they pose."
">the stupid ones have some excuse.


They absolutely do not. Being uneducated isn't related to being vindictive and cruel. Some of the kindest, most caring and generous people I've ever known have been developmentally disabled folks who couldn't count to 20."
"The allies decided not to kill Hitler despite having several opportunities to assassinate him. They didn't because they knew Hitler was overriding his generals and issuing orders that were terrible for military strategic goals. 

Evil and stupid can still be a catastrophe for the planet."
"I wouldn't say they have an excuse.  I would, however, say it at least makes it less likely they'll be successful in their evil deeds.

Unfortunately, some powerful idiots are surrounded by smart vultures and scavengers."
"I agree it‚Äôs likely more evil than stupid, but I‚Äôd like to point out that educated and stupid aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.  For instance: Trump‚Äôs business degree comes from a prestigious university."

Oh cool. Thanks for the explanation.
"It‚Äôs not teaching on the basis of skin color, though it‚Äôs teaching someone‚Äôs cultural and ethnic heritage."
"I'm arguing that Americans should be able to name them, not that they can.

If I asked the average person who immediately followed Abraham Lincoln as president and how his policies shaped America, I suspect many couldn't answer that question effectively.  But that doesn't mean that American history should exclude Andrew Johnson or his effect on shaping the US."
"You can read Florida‚Äôs state academic standards the the article cites [here.](https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf) It seems to be a pretty normal teaching of black history and covers things that Reddit likes to say is glossed over in school like the Tulsa race massacre. Some excerpts:

>Instruction includes the harsh conditions and their consequences on British American
plantations (e.g., undernourishment, climate conditions, infant and child mortality rates of the enslaved
vs. the free)

>Instruction includes how slave codes resulted in an enslaved person becoming property
with no rights.

>Instruction includes how the demand for slave labor resulted in a large, forced
migration.

>Instruction includes the ramifications of prejudice, racism and stereotyping on
individual freedoms (e.g., the Civil Rights Cases, Black Codes, Jim Crow Laws, lynchings, Columbian
Exposition of 1893).

> Instruction includes acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans but
is not limited to 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, 1919 Washington, D.C. Race Riot, 1920 Ocoee Massacre, 1921
Tulsa Massacre and the 1923 Rosewood Massacre.

>Instruction includes the push and pull factors of the Great Migration. (e.g., race riots,
socio-economic factors, political rights, how African Americans suffered infringement of rights through
racial oppression, segregation, discrimination)."
"Why didn't you include this part?

>Last year, DeSantis‚Äô administration blocked a new Advanced Placement course on African American Studies from being taught in Florida, saying it violates state law and is historically inaccurate.
A spokesperson for the College Board, which oversees Advanced Placement courses, told the AP they are not aware of any public schools in Florida currently offering the African American Studies class. It‚Äôs also not listed in the state‚Äôs current course directory.

Is this [Advanced Placement course on African American Studies](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/conerns-ap-african-american-studies-course-florida.jpg) something these ""advocates"" are upset about not being taught in Florida classrooms?"
Ruby Bridges just turned 70 a couple months ago. This is absolutely not ancient history.
"> If you genuinely think I said that schools ""don't include slavery"" in any form as part of their curriculum, here's a great organization for improving your reading comprehension. 

It's funny that you say that when you're the one with bad reading comprehension. Read the [216-page document](https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf) that you linked too. It very much portrays slavery as a bad thing. It covers all of the major events in the civil rights movement. It also portrays African Americans positively. Variations of ""Positive influences/contributions by African Americans"" appears over a dozen times.

What part of black history is not being covered?"
I‚Äôve never once met someone who was educated on Japanese American internment camps in school.

"But at the same time, it's worth learning why it made sense to pick Parks instead - it was (intentionally) as much a PR exercise as a civil litigation case, and if there's one thing that modern protest movements (BLM comes to mind) should learn from the past, it's that you need to have good PR, because the moneyed interests opposing you certainly will. It's still something that is a more in-depth topic than ""it's February, MLK was like super cool and ended racism, also Malcom X was mean and he was like the other guy who wasn't MLK, George Wallace wanted segregation but he lost, OK now it's March let's talk about something else."""

"If they treat the subject like it‚Äôs ancient history and don‚Äôt tell you that Ruby Bridges hasn‚Äôt even retired yet, I agree."
"Certainly hard, but there were nonetheless records of slaves who were able to earn money over time (whether that be because their owners chose to pay them, or because they did paid labor with accumulated skills in their free time), and eventually were able to buy their freedom."
do people in the South really believe this? Who in the South figures it out?  Do they have to go to college outside of the south?
"As it relates to the latter of the two links, iirc, the lesson plan had comparable wording to the AP course for black history. It was about slaves learning useful skills, and leveraging them to their benefit *in spite* of slavery, not because of it. Unfortunately, that didn't stop media outlets from misrepresenting things for a quick headline."
"1st link is paywall. 2nd link still doesn't say ""happy"".

In fact, your 2nd link refutes everything you say. Thank you."
And I watched Roots in my social studies class in middle school. I have no idea who you people are meeting in life that do not have a basic understanding of slavery in the US and how awful it was. And this idea that it's whitewashed in schools is pure bullshit.
"Who the fuck thinks trading ""people"" isn't a fucking horror and atrocity? Who needs that explained to them?  Your nephew? If that's the case, a new curriculum isn't gonna help him."
"Nope, I'm not going to argue your racist straw man. My sister is a **math** major who went on to become a civil engineer. She wouldn't have been required to take African American History courses according to her program's website. If you want to participate in a melting pot society, refusing to try to understand anyone else's perspective and your own history can only be to your (and society's) detriment. But feel free to live under a rock."
"The fact that the teacher's daughter is also encouraging her classmates to join her in no way implies that she OR them are the only the only students in the class. As it even says earlier in the article,

>In an old wooden bungalow in Delray Beach, Charlene Farrington and her staff gather groups of teenagers on Saturday mornings to teach them lessons she worries that public schools won‚Äôt provide.

Groups of teenagers. Plural.

You wouldn't read a statement from an eyewitness to an event and assume they're the only one who was there, would you?"
r/confidentlyincorrect
"According to the article, they reference ‚Äúteenagers‚Äù (plural) and stated that the student you mention also invites their friends (plural). There‚Äôs also a photo slideshow that shows the teacher standing in ‚Äúone of the classrooms where she teaches‚Äù (classrooms being plural). Let us know if you need further help. I realize that not all of us are literacy buffs. Or you can just delete your post, /u/nervous-peen... I won't laugh too hard."

*Evil shall always triumph... because good is dumb.*
Smart and evil is also usually more quiet about their evilness
"Truer words have rarely been spoken (or in this case, typed)."
"In a similar vein, the kindest people I have met are poor people in rural areas, either in my country or overseas.

"Cool. You can read about just some of the issues people have about that specific curiculum and the laws/agendas bringing it about in the comment you're replying to. Maybe do that first next time before replying to it.

There is also exactly one reference I can find to Tulsa in that linked curriculum btw:

>""Clarification 2: Instruction includes acts of violence perpetrated against **and by** African Americans but is not limited to 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, 1919 Washington, D.C. Race Riot, 1920 Ocoee Massacre, 1921 Tulsa Massacre and the 1923 Rosewood Massacre.""

This is exactly the kind of thing the second quote explicitly referred to: ""teaching about how black people were also perpetrators of violence during race massacres"".

So... One mention about Tulsla, in a big list of other events, and in ""clarification 2 of 3"" with an explicit reference to the exact ""both sides were bad actually"" framing.

If this isn't ""glossing over"" I have no idea what you think glossing over looks like. Half a mention? Just writing ""Tul"" all the way down in a hypothetical clarification 5?"
"Because that is a random newer AP course and we're talking about the changes to core class materials right now, the ones where they're changing the way history is taught to demand teachers teach the benefits of slavery and other nonsense.

""Desantis is demanding teachers STOP teaching parts of american history that he thinks make white people uncomfortable, or teach it in ways that go out of their way to sell the upsides of slavery and other travesties"" is a very different topic than ""New unrelated AP course banned.""

We're not going to fall for the jangling keys trying to distract people from the topic, thanks.

Hope. This. Helps. :)"
"Exactly. Ruby bridges,one of the very first students to go to a formerly all-white school, is still alive today. She had to be escorted by federal marshals for her safety. She was six years old.

Many of the people she had to be protected from are still alive too. People threatened to kill her. All but one teacher refused to teach her. Parents en masse pulled their children out of school rather than send them to school with a six year old black girl. The marshals made sure Ruby never ate anything but the food she brought from home. Some had thretened to poison her.

Those parents taught their kids to hate too. Some of those parents were pretty young at the time... They'd be florida-retirement age. The kids she went to school with definitely are. They don't like when the grandkids learn about the civil rights movement, or think that grandpa was bad because he was one of the kids throwing rocks."
"Please direct yourself to Reading Rockets to work on your reading comprehension. You seem to be very confused, because I already quoted the issues in the previous artitcle - including people saying that the new curriculum had new meddling clarifications instructing teachers to emphasize that slaves had benefited in some ways from labor they were forced to do while slaves.

>Examine the various duties and trades performed by slaves (e.g., agricultural work, painting, carpentry, tailoring, domestic service, blacksmithing, transportation).   
  
Clarification 1: Instruction includes **how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.**

Intestesting. Sure looks exactly like the article's complaints said. People are offended by instructing teachers to emphasize unimportant and obvious ""slaves were forced how to do things that their owners forced them to learn how to do"" and the specific note that these skills could also be applied for their personal benefit. People are offended that this was added for the same reason it was obviously added: another example of trying to add a positive spin to black suffering.

Likewise, the **only** mention of Tulsa is in a specific clarification to emphasize that some black people also committed violence during race massacres: 

>Clarification 2: Instruction includes acts of violence perpetrated against **and by** African Americans but is not limited to 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, 1919 Washington, D.C. Race Riot, 1920 Ocoee Massacre, 1921 Tulsa Massacre and the 1923 Rosewood Massacre.

This is also included in the comment you're replying to.

I'm not going to take your bait further. On top of the curriculum backing up exactly what the quotes said was in it, scant lists of topics do not reflect the way the material is actually taught in the classes - as a product of other laws and policies passed that have been exhaustively quoted.

We've given you the article, relevant quotes, and a link to an organization that helps reading comprehension. The rest is up to you."

The Nicene Creed is not the definition of Christianity. Christianity existed for 300 years before the Council of Nicaea and there are plenty of denominations that existed before and after it that don't follow its creed. Nicene Christianity is just the most enduring variation because it had the sanction of emperors and state churches.
The only sect that adheres to the Nicene creed as law is Catholicism. You can add or subtract any part of it and still be considered Christian. Just not Catholic.
"What if i told you  the people your talking about had the capacity to learn skills without being slaves and you shouldnt glorify slavery by their ability to learn stuff

Even the way you worderd it gos against your previous comment as it reads like they only learned skills out of the nacasity to free themself from enslavement, it reads like lazy propaganda like "" see something good came out of this, so its not all bad"""
"Well gee, lucky them."
It‚Äôs weird that you‚Äôre all over this thread absolutely insisting that Florida is accurately teaching Black history when it‚Äôs very well documented that Florida is doing no such thing. The state literally banned schools from offering the AP African American Studies class this year.
"Per other comments, Florida is actively mandating teaching the ""slaves were happy and learning life skills"" conservative approach to the Civil War, et al."
"Who said we're meeting people who don't understand what slavery was? Thanks to Roots and movies/series/books like it, we have a collective consciousness about it. Not from the Florida educational system in the 1980s though. (They didn't play Roots in middle school, for example).

The concern is that as the educational system erodes even further from constant conservative pressures to privatize our tax dollars, the current and future generations might grow into adulthood ignorant to tons of important history (the Holocaust also wasn't taught accurately in the deep south last century, another example)."
"The US govt didn't think it was that big a deal, they did it for 300 years, made the country rich ass hell and nobody went to jail for it,black people have never received reparations.  And also it's citizens, y'all were complicit 100%. 

But you're also missing the entire fucking point Jesus. My nephews 6th grade text book history course described it as this, that's the point, they want to water down history and make it seem not so horrible what white people did."
"Read /u/Nervous-Peen comments. It's clear he did read, and is just being the usual piece of shit that's been crawling out of the woodwork lately. At best, he's a bot."
"LMAO it's 1am and I misread your comment, forgive me. If it makes you feel better, just realize that I was ready to throw down for your honor."
"Well kinda, but that's exactly how evil always plants the seeds for its own destruction.   
  
Nobody ever expects the village idiot to suddenly do something clever after years of cheerfully performing menial labor and getting spat on.

I was raised by evil, which believes that good is dumb. My dad is currently involved in a scheme that I think is designed to force me into being his caretaker in his old age. Like his useless slave escaped and now that it'll come in handy again he wants it back in chains, not like loving family stuff you'd normally picture.

He's got zero idea how much he'd regret getting what he's plotting to get. Now that he's frail and weak and helpless, me staying away from him is a kindness. Same with not talking to him, I know nearly all of his most shameful secrets and worst nightmares so it's a kindness to not talk to him."
"I have a theory on this too. That this idea of villains all being morons seems kind of abstract until you realize it's a consistent narrative in comics and shows. The idea of the overambitious moustache twiddling scoundrel and his bumbling henchmen. In these stories lies the ever present maxim that good simply *always* prevails over evil. Good just finds a way every time. 



 Similarly, when facing these villains, they expect heroes to come to their rescue. All while failing to realize that when everybody's waiting for one rather than stepping up, the hero never comes. That or if one should appear, they overestimate them and the hero fails to deliver.



The only way any of that changes is if the evil change their hearts or the decent grow tired enough of waiting for heroes to do what they should've been doing themselves."

"The ""Florida‚Äôs public schools will now teach students that some Black people benefited from slavery because it taught them useful skills"" is from a single line in the academic standard. Is that glossing over it too? Or are we going to pretend that one line is a massive part of Florida's Black history curriculum?"
"It doesn‚Äôt help, I‚Äôve learned that 99% of the people JAQing off (Just Asking Questions) aren‚Äôt *really* asking those questions in good faith. It‚Äôs better to save your time at this point, for someone who is actually ignorant to the subject.

Fuck.     It's all buzzwords and arm flailing.
"You have to try harder. You aren't even fooling yourself with this stuff. No one thinks that teachers are suddenly dedicating whole days of class to all the cool ways slavery built slave CVs based on that direction.

I would **expect** this to be glossed over as a random weird interjection a teacher is embarassed they had to make and then quickly hurried on to other things, which is a good thing because it's a nonsense point and shouldn't exist at all.

But even among that lame surely glossed-over point... Tusla's callout gets even less than that.

The ""slavery taught skills sometimes"" is the entire point of its clarification, specifically interjected to make sure teachers make that point.

By contrast, the point of the clarification that includes Tusla's lone reference is to spread the blame for race massacers when they come up. The guideline is to name black americans as both victims **and perpetrators** during these horrific events. Tulsa is solely included as one of 5 examples of the type of event you shoulds spread the blame for.

That's *worse* than not mentioning it because you **only** mentioned it in the context of reminding people to spread the blame when it comes up.

I asked you a question. What would *NOT* getting glossed over look like here? Just half a reference ""Tus"" in sub-clarification 5?"
Oh absolutely. I write for other people reading the thread. No one can accuse me of building a strawman when you've got someone intentionally saying dumb stuff like this to try and derail the conversation. I just don't let it happen and use them to make the point for other readers.
"Okay so let's say ""sect"" if you're going to be pedantic. My point is, they were Christian. They centered Jesus Christ in their theology, and *that's* the definition of Christianity."
"The Orthodox Church is irrelevant as their denominationalism is outside the scope of the discussion. For the rest, the very definition of Protestantism is rejection of Catholic teachings- whether individual sects hold to it or not is irrelevant to whether a specific one has to. There is no governing body that says ""all Protestants must believe this"". Well, other than the mighty /u/evsboi of course."
"your reading your intent into your own comment as someone who has already formed the opinion that yes slavery is bad and people regardless of their situation can learn skills.

that won't be true of every small human learning about this stuff. and if they are taught that ""slave masters had them learn skills"" all their life its not much of a leap to form the conclusion of "" they benefited from slavery""  for plenty of people.

  
people love to think that others, think and will form the same opinions they do... they often do not..."
"> I‚Äôve also, at no point, argued that Florida is ‚Äúaccurately teaching black history‚Äù

""I have, at no point, taken a position as to the accuracy of Florida's Black history curriculum; however, I have repeatedly and vehemently objected to any suggestion that Florida's Black history curriculum is not accurate."""
"Smart, smart. I just find it hilarious how obvious these people are once you recognize it for what it really is the first time."
"I never said anything about slave owners making them learn skills. I don't know why you put that in quotes like you were quoting me. (I know it wasn't your intent, but for all your talk about it being possible to misinterpret what I said, that feels a bit ironic.)

And combining that with the context that my immediate prior comment is about how slaves learned and utilized these skills *in spite* of their enslavement, not because of it, and nothing in the second comment contradicts that interpretation, this feels like unnecessary nitpicking.

At a certain point, if someone wants to willfully misinterpret what I said, that's on them. The alternative would be including an excessive number of disclaimers and clarifications, then repeating them every comment because you don't trust the reader to use basic context clues to understand what you're saying."
"Agreed. In the spirit of optimism though, some people do eventually run across a lie from their cult-leader that they *know* is wrong and that makes them suddenly question other things... Or they have some good experiences with people they were taught to fear... And then some of the things they dismissed before resurface and can wave together like a liferaft.

Sometimes you're just planting the seeds for their ""oh heck I was kind of an idiot"" moment 5-10 years down the line. It's ultimately on them to grab the raft when they realize this instead of doubling down, but some do."
"I've heard the Nicene Creed used by evangelicals to say, for example, that Mormons aren't ""real"" Christians. But they self-identify as Christian, so what other than sectarianism justifies denying them that label? Nicene Christianity defined itself as the ""true"" Christianity for 2000 years through the institutional power of popes and kings, but there have always been forms of Christianity existing outside of it. I mean what's your opinion of the Coptic church? Does the Council of Chalcedon define Christianity too?"

This has more detail and doesn‚Äôt include some of the more graphic images the ny post did. The nbc link has a photo of the suspect at the top so I‚Äôm sharing it so people in the nyc area can keep an eye out without have to read more details.

"So when that man was choked to death by a passenger on the subway and the killer was subsequently found innocent, a lot of people complained that it was too far and that the other guy was harmless. 

THIS is why. These are the fucking crazy people on the train that people don't want to deal with."
This is the worse way to go. It is torture. There should be a manhunt ordered right away. How will women feel safe to go on the train again?
Are women getting a hotline to call over fears and concerns regarding this murder?
"Fucking horrible.  Many years ago I intervened on a NYC Subway with a man harassing a woman after a Knicks game.  Nearly lost my life before throwing the guy off the train at a stop.

Nothing ever came of it after that.  The woman was so shaken up."
Dude wtf is going on with those NYC trains
"Saw the video at other sources - that female passenger was just standing inside the train car, with its doors open, with parts of her body burning, while some random transit cop casually walking by, glancing at her, then keeping walking while talking to someone on walkie-takie, and the person who was filming it from the platform and other bystanders were also watching, none of whom attempted to extinguish her....

Typical day in NYC. Glad I moved out of that shithole of a city."
This is insane. I feel for the victim‚Äôs family.
Remember when that random guy was punching women in the face?
Set him on fire once they find him guilty. Subhuman garbage.
">Police officers conducting a routine patrol at the Stillwell Avenue subway station encountered the victim on fire inside a subway car, Glickman said


Wait. Were there no other passengers in the car who could've tried to smother the flames or call the police such that it was a routine patrol that happened upon her?"
People have officially lost their minds
Where is Daniel Penny when you need him.
"This scares me infintely more than Luigi.  Like any of the other millions of commuters minding their own business, and just like that some morherfucker lights you on fire"
"I'm gonna be honest, I stopped taking the subway in NYC a long time ago. Lots of unsafe and sketchy situations to the point where I felt like I was playing roulette. But I'd be lying if I said ""being intentionally set on fire"" was on that list of concerns at any point"
"""EMS prounounced the victim dead""

Considering what it takes for EMS to be allowed to declare someone dead vs take them to the hospital for a doctor to declare them dead, this is pretty horrific."
"For Christmas I bought the other girlies in my life who all work in Manhattan some more hard core ""self defense devices""....when I say I am terrified they will be attacked, pushed onto the subway, stabbed for no reason, followed into their building, an elevator, etc. it is fckn SCARY to be a woman anywhere but NYC/cities just has so many extra levels of danger.  after I got into a weird scary situation recently where a drugged up man trapped me in between my car and the bushes asking for money, that was the final straw and now I carry a taser."
Was she a billionaire or CEO? No? Sorry looks like the crook got away
"I get the cynicism here, but when a murder makes the news - especially a high-profile murder of (presumably) a stranger on the subway - the NYPD does investigate it. There's already a [picture of the suspect](https://brooklyn.news12.com/fdny-1-killed-in-fire-at-coney-island-subway-platform) out.

Edit: and the suspect's already been identified and arrested as of 4:30 this afternoon."
There are some seriously shitty people in existence.
Jesus christ wtf is wrong with our society!
What the absolute fuck
"Fuck as a New Yorker this is terrifying. Millions in the city use the subways every day ontop of ppl coming in from Long Island. It‚Äôs genuinely insane how my teachers had to warn us to not go near the tracks so nobody could push us in. There were also clearly mentally ill and homeless people on the trains who were trying to start a fight.

This shit happens every single time. The city has a clear problem and it‚Äôs not being addressed. There is no help being given and we deserve better. This is our home and there should be something that lessens this issue. All that has happened is just a lot of us growing more and more scared."
"And watch the perp will not be perp walked with FBI, Police and a mayor. Sickening."
What‚Äôs wrong with people that they‚Äôd do something so evil on a subway?
"Surely there's  lots of video available. Undoubtedly the NYPD has released multiple still photos of the perp and have scoured cameras all over the city to trace his activity and whereabouts over the past 2-3 weeks, right?"
Will the mayor hold a press conference and want to look the assailant in the eye?
"""is next to the Macy‚Äôs department store that was featured in the 1947 film ‚ÄúMiracle on 34th Street""

This is important information, I'm glad it was included in the write-up"
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck burning to death has gotta be one of the worst ways to go.
Didn‚Äôt Adams throw millions of dollars for additional policing on the subway? Are they just there to make sure folks don‚Äôt skip on fare or‚Ä¶ wut?
"What the fuck is wrong with people, seriously!???"
"I was in a car fire once, got burned pretty bad.

  
Nobody deserves to die this way."
Where is the 24/7 coverage of this hate crime?
"So no name? Really. Not hard to see why. He should get the same fucking treatment. What other justice is there? 
Trial, sure why not, but he gets the same fucking treatment as what he gave. That is what she is owed. That is what he deserves."
TW this footage appears to show a cop walking by and doing nothing while she burned alive [https://x.com/taliaotg/status/1870911358310736033](https://x.com/taliaotg/status/1870911358310736033)
This is why dudes get choked out on the subway.
"This is a horrific tragedy.

If NYPD puts less effort into finding this cruel, vicious murdered than they did to find Mangione it will only confirm that rich people matter more. 

And if Eric Adams doesn‚Äôt attend the perp walk because he wants to ‚Äúlook this man in the eyes‚Äú his utter lack of integrity, honor, and soul will be on full display."
"""Just don't make eye contact and mind your own busines bro!"""
"I want to see a multi-state manhunt and a $60,000 reward, MINIMUM"
I am not terrorized by Luigi. I am terrorized by people who shouldn‚Äôt be here in the first place setting people on fire.
Q: why is the killer called a Man when the victim is a Female?
"A woman burned to death and no one did anything about it or tried to help. Literally just walking on by. What is wrong with our society that people will ignore a person who is literally on fire screaming and dying. 

And people here are talking about race and how cheaply made fabrics and clothing burn quickly and homelessness and not sleeping on trains??? This is the focus?  A woman burned to death and died screaming and no one lifted a finger. That‚Äôs the problem that people should be talking about."
Is this guy a terrorist? Or was the victim not wealthy enough?
"I've seen the video. It's insane...

It's insane because a human being lit another human being on fire. It's insane because the woman who is on fire is literally just standing there on fire mostly motionless and not making a sound. It's insane because literally *no one* performed any helpful action, most stood around saying ""dayum"" except for one idiot who waved a sweatshirt around in the air which mostly just fanned the flames. It's insane because even the cops were there and they didn't do a fucking thing either.

Having seen this, there's nothing anyone here can say to convince me that NYC isn't a festering shithole that magnetically attracts the worst people the human race has on offer. How can this be the state of things in AD 2024? Where we're perfectly comfortable watching someone burn alive on a fucking train, a week after we all idolize the guy who fucking killed a man from behind on the street in the same city?"
Shit like this is exactly why I have no ill will against Daniel Penny. The subways in most of our major cities need to looked at.
How horrible. That poor woman.
Too bad Daniel Penny wasn‚Äôt present
So is the mayor going to use all available resources to hunt this person down and then perp walk them like they did Luigi?
https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/ Images of the suspect
Oh my effing God! That is horrifying
The video is horrific. The murderer must be found and also burned to death.
"Keep it classy New York, you guys have a problem."
We need to start doing awful things to these people in town squares again. Might make them think twice.
Perp will probably be prosecuted less ferociously than Penny
"One time some drunk psycho tried to set fire to my clothes with a lighter at a crowded bar. I barely had time to register what was going on before the biggest bouncer I‚Äôve ever seen lifted the guy up by the collar and straight up carried him out the door. Luckily jeans don‚Äôt ignite too well so nothing happened to me.

Another time a guy at a bar tried to set my hair on fire because he reasoned it was too long for a man.

Maybe I should reevaluate the kind of bars I frequent."
Bro this has absolutely nothing to do with the CEO shooting‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall are projecting everything.
"Just so everyone knows, he‚Äôs been caught by the NYPD!  Fantastic work!"
Notice that most of the subway victims the past few years have been women?
"Remember, it's not terrorism if you just kill random people."
And what would have happened if a witness had caught the perp and choked him out? Would you be a hero or a murderer?
When will the $10K reward be offered? Was this an act of terror? Better get the McDonalds slueth in Pennsylvania on the case while NYPD and the major is giving another press conference.
And nobody tried to help because now they're afraid to intervene and be put on trial like Daniel Penny...
NYC has lost the plot. It‚Äôs so sad. Literal Gotham City.
Wouldn't of happened if Daniel Penny was there.
"This is why people put guys in chokeholds on trains. It's not because they want to kill them, it's to keep them from killing someone else."
"It's the ""watching her burn to death"", part for me. Didn't even run to avoid getting caught. Just watched his handiwork from start to finish. Utter cruelty."
now let's see if they give him the death penalty like they want for Luigi
Apparently there were liquor bottles found on the train so maybe he used some high-proof alcohol
I've seen the footage on twitter and she was standing there... burning with the ground under her also on fire. So I assume an accelerant was doused around.
Maybe she was sleeping and he set her clothing on fire
"100% had to be some accelerant used (e.g. gasoline, ethanol, etc.)"
If someone is wearing all the wrong type of fabrics it could be that easy.
"Depends somewhat what you are wearing.  Heavy denim or something wont really burn like this, some synthetics are basically condensed petroleum products.

But yeah looks like some sort of accelerant in this case."
"holy shit, i really hope that in a situation like that the body shuts down quickly but i have big doubts.... Poor lady, what an awfull way of being killed..."
"Wait, how was he not found to be criminally responsible?!?!"
How is this not considered a hate crime? It was purely motivated by her nationality.
[removed]
Sounds like a possibility. More info and a blurry photo of the suspect in other news articles like this one:¬†https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/woman-set-on-fire-nyc-subway/
A lot of people who commute sleep on the train.
"[Happened in Chicago recently](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/chicago/news/cta-fatal-shooting-court/), dude shot and killed 4 sleeping people on the train at about 7am. Was an attack on homeless folks. Horrible :("
"Jesus fucking christ, I need to stop following the news. I can't keep reading shit like this and getting THIS angry that bastards just exist out there.

The subways trains rock so falling asleep on the train is common for anyone
"Whether the female was homeless or the suspect was homeless, New Yorkers deserve better. That also includes homeless people wandering the streets of NYC. I don‚Äôt understand how NYC, having the largest economy in the US, can‚Äôt take care of their own."
Geez you don‚Äôt have to be homeless to fall asleep on a train. This is so horrific.
Dude got arrested already fortunately.
"Just watched the press conference, they got him."
NY Post said a suspect was arrested as of an hour ago
They already have him
It sure is terrifying. I can't imagine even just being one of the people who saw this.
NY has [charged people with terrorism](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/05/new-york-subway-shooter-frank-james-life-sentence) for attempted murder on the subway before. So yeah actually it might be
She wasn‚Äôt rich enough
I‚Äôm certainly way more terrified of being randomly set on fire as an average citizen using public transportation than I am of being shot while walking into a shareholder meeting at my $20M/yr job where I‚Äôm about to brag about how we increased everyone in the room‚Äôs net worth by letting people who paid us to help them suffer and die to raucous applause.
"> Terrorism (n): the unlawful use of violence, or the threat of violence, to achieve political or ideological objectives 

Just because it‚Äôs scary doesn‚Äôt make it terrorism. Maybe it was terrorism, but nothing in the articles I‚Äôve seen so far suggests that it was."
Not done with a political sentiment.
"It‚Äôs an act of a mentally ill homeless man 


There is a political discussion to be had here as well"
Terrorism is about whether the act was done in the pursuit of political aims
Was it done for political or ideological reasons?
Did the murderer write a manifesto?
"Probably not, since it doesn't meet the definition of terrorism. (More information could come to light to change that.)

>**New York Penal Law ¬ß 490.25** A person is guilty of a crime of terrorism when, with intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping, he or she commits a specified offense."
Did the perpetrator have a written manifesto?
idk did the suspect write a manifesto beforehand?
Why would it be? What was the political/ideological motive?
What do you think the definition of terrorism is?
The whole scene was a glimpse of the real depravity plaguing us
"For sure he‚Äôs gonna wanna look em in the eyes‚Ä¶

[**‚ÄùMayor Eric Adams says: He wanted to look Mangione in the eye during perp walk‚Äù**](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5051407-nyc-mayor-adams-accused-shooting/amp/)"
"Mayor will be doing a presser about how he is surprised and disappointed that one of his allies in the NYPD has stepped down due to sexual assault allegations

If this happened in midtown Manhattan,  800+ officers will be deployed to the subways to arrest fare dodgers / turnstile jumpers

If this happened in a poorer borough, standard NYPD apb

Also how did he set her on fire ? Was there an accelerant used ?"
"I look forward to the New York Times Op-Eds.

Oh wait, the victim didn't deny healthcare access for millions of Americans while stuffing her own pockets with millions? Then I think it's just charged as Misdemeanor Death by Immolation."
"And the drones, the FBI, that $60k reward money, etc

Now we'll see how much the NYPD cares about the weakest among us as they do the most powerful"
"> So settle your self righteous ass back down pls.

seems like you could've taken this advice in the first place"
"Seems she was likely homeless. He doesn't care. 

We had a serial killer targeting homeless men years ago and Eric Adams not only was the likely cause of the immense hatred of homeless people in NYC, he didn't say shit about it. A homeless man was murdered like 3 blocks from City Hall and he didn't even make face time at the memorial."
"I mean even with your edit, it kinda points out the flaw in your post. You made this assumption based on your pessimist preconceptions about the police not caring when the underprivileged gets murdered. Oh, but it turns out they actually caught the murderer the same fucking day. So maybe you and the 22k people upvoting you should take this as a sign that you don't actually know what the fuck you're talking about, and you should be the one sitting your self-righteous ass down and shutting the fuck up."
You'll edit hard to defend yourself but you wouldn't DARE delete your virtue-signalling inaccurate ass comment
Unless she was a CEO I don‚Äôt see that happening very efficiently
Are the drones in the air? Where is the FBI with their AI face recognition software looking at the camera footage? Is there $70k in reward money for tips?
‚ÄúWell we‚Äôve kind of blown the manhunt budget for the rest of this fiscal year. But we‚Äôll look into it after New Years.‚Äù
"Don't throw a tantrum, just take the L.

By your logic, and the logic of the other morons in the thread, the NYPD cares more about this incident that they did the CEO shooter."
What a great comment. Perfectly puts into relief what the issue is
"You have to be a CEO of health insurance to get that kind of package. Sorry, unfortunately the police insurance you paid for just doesn't cover that kind of trauma for families. However your rates are going to start solid this year."
Im hearing he was just caught in Manhattan. Thankfully he was caught before he could do it again.
Looks like they got him already
">Three high school-aged New Yorkers called 911 after spotted the alleged suspect on another moving train later in the day Sunday.


Maybe some of the kids are alright after all"
I caught a glimpse of the video..the victim was standing?  How is that possible?
Thank you!
"The video is truly horrifying. And no one‚Äôs doing anything, not the person filming, not the cop just standing there. They‚Äôre watching a woman burn to death like it‚Äôs nothing."
I‚Ä¶ wonder why she didn‚Äôt scream‚Ä¶? In the video I saw she just stood there how do you not scream
Thy already got the guy but theres your upvotes
"Oh good, a tiered law enforcement system!"
They already arrested this guy. Seems like this zany hypothetical didn‚Äôt come true.
ahh yes some classic reddit shithead sarcasm. The guy's already been caught.
"""can we investigate this murder?""

""And divert funds from the Mangione transportation budget?! He's not going anywhere with less than 3 precincts worth of guards!"""
Genuinely curious why everyone has decided this is the case? When did NYPD say they‚Äôre not going to investigate this?
Didn‚Äôt age well hmm?
"what in the eff. how are you already using the burning of this woman as your political bludgeon? you people are shameless.

nothing but your narrative. always. everything is about your narrative. and you honestly think ""youre the good guys"".

you have no idea just how alike you are to all the people you hate so much. youre indistinguashable from them. which is why you hate them."
You are an awful human being
"Start the manhunt now.

ETA: they should be swift with femicide and terrorism charges too, right? ‚Ä¶right?!"
It literally says in the first sentence they arrested someone.
"Why are you acting like all the ""wasted"" resources that went into finding Luigi can't also be used to catch this criminal, even though he was apprehended much quicker than Luigi?"
"For real. Random shit like this is truly terrifying. Maybe my logic is flawed, but Luigi had reasons for doing what he is alleged to have done. I‚Äôm not justifying it, I‚Äôm just saying he had reasons."
Arrest has been made according to the first paragraph of the article
"You don't need to apologize. When reagan emptied them, they were supposed to get replaced with new, better, and ethically run facilities and services... but he didn't replace them, and no one in the last 45 years has bothered to revisit the problem."
They already arrested him so there‚Äôs that at least
"Gotta first check if she's billionaire CEO.

No, she's not?  Sorry, guys.  This looks like a tough one that will likely never get solved."
"Published 1h ago, so roughly 7h later."
"dude. all you people are instantly using this woman being burned alive as your political bludgeon. its disgusting.

youre not the ""good people"". youre exactly like the people you hate so much."
"New York really doesn't care about all the innocent women that get harassed, stalked, sexually abused, assaulted, even graped or murdered daily they just care about what happens to the CEOs & other wealthy elites living there.

This is what the government & law enforcement show through their actions, ignore their words."
"I think Luigi‚Äôs target wasn‚Äôt identified as a CEO until around 2pm, so it was actually the same amount of time."
It says it was at 7:30am. On a Sunday. There may not have been many/any bystanders
"that subway station is the end of the line for the F line and alot of trains, it's likely the train was sitting there with no one else on it other than those who fell asleep. like the last stop on a bus."
"> Where were the bystanders

Bystanders who help are hauled off to a trial and possibly found guilty for trying to help.

So nobody wants to try and help anymore."
"After the trial of Daniel Penny, do you really think those people are going to be inclined to help stop violent assailants?"
"According to news accounts, it was on an empty train, except for the two of them, at the end of the train line at 7:30 am on a Sunday.  And in Brooklyn vs manhattan"
"If the reports that she was homeless are correct, then let me explain something since I'm guessing you don't live in NYC.

At 7 am on a Sunday, the trains are mostly empty.  Nobody that can help it will willingly board a train car with a passed out homeless person except during rush hour when they really have to.  It's the smell.  You can tell who's new to NYC because they see an uncrowded train car and head to that one thinking they'll be able to find a seat, it's a mistake you learn not to make pretty fast.

So it's entirely possible it was just her and the attacker in that wagon."
Like penny or goetz?
Probably don‚Äôt want to end up like Daniel Penny
"Thank you for defending her, not everyone has the courage to do that these days"
Back in the 70s or 80s they were so bad and no one was doing enough about it that vigilante groups formed to tackle the issue.
"I was beaten at a subway station in 2019 at 8:30 in the morning by a stranger. So I also have questions (and the NYPD response was very slow, it took like 25 minutes for some to come from a station over. And the police wanted me to talk to them at the station before an ambulance for dispatched jfc)."
"I think the NYC subway has been a problem for *decades*. In fact, it used to be *much* worse than it is now."
Are you serious? i lived in NYC at the height of the crack epidemic and there were crimes on the subway every day but since crimes were ubiquitous the NY media never bothered covering them unless a tourist was killed.
It transports millions of people without incident. Statistically weird shit is going to happen every now and then. Still more likely to get hurt driving a car.
"Even more unsettling, the man sitting in front calmly watching her slowly burn to death WAS the perpetrator. He just sat there the whole time and the first responders didn't even notice..

""Unbeknownst to the officers who responded, the suspect had stayed on the scene and was seated on a bench on the platform just outside the train car, and the body-worn cameras on the responding officers produced a very clear detailed look at the killer,‚Äù Tisch said. She noted the suspect appeared calm when he initially approached the victim."""
i think he was running to find a fire extinguisher (if i had to guess)
"I just watched it, and how on earth? Why is she just standing there, *still in the car*? Why are bystanders not trying to rescue her or smother the flames, just filming?

Doesn't stop drop roll apply here? Perhaps wrapping her in a coat rather than fanning the flames? It kinda looks like no one cares to try very hard to save this woman."
That‚Äôs the end of the line for the F so it‚Äôs possible no one was on the train other than those two at that time.
There won‚Äôt be another Daniel Penny after what they put him through.
"Penny is the natural predator to all the vile and dangerous men roaming the subways and streets.  We need more of him not fewer.

If your land is inundated with wild boars you introduce a wolf into their environment to cull the herd."
"When I worked EMS we were deputy coroners.  I actually thought this was pretty common, if not standard.  Maybe not.  I‚Äôm in a different state."
It‚Äôs different state to state. Where I work EMS can‚Äôt declare a patient dead that died while being treated (like during cpr for example) but if we get called for a person who is showing obvious signs of death when we arrive on scene we can call time of death.
"You're thinking of first responders which can be the ems but is also whoever is first on scene with first aid training, but i believe EMS can declare death."
"There are specific criteria called 'injuries incompatible with life'. Specifically:

1. Head removed from body or crushed
2. Body cut in half
3. Full-thickness burns (charring) to >95% of body surface.

There's a further 3 that are more just recognition that the person is in fact well and dead:

1.  Decomposition/putrefaction
2. Rigor mortis
3. Pooling blood on the underside of the body. 

For anything else, they need to do CPR and get even an obviously dead or imminently dying person to the hospital."

Nooo muh narrative‚Ä¶
Yes he has been arrested

Isn't there already a $10k reward offered per article?"
"The linked article already says that there is a $10K reward, dumb-dumb.  But we shouldn‚Äôt bother reading the articles, right?!  Just keep doing your outrage warrior bullshit."

"I've started *a lot* of camp fires. Maybe I am doing it wrong, but it's not so easy to start a fire with drinking alcohol. The hand sanitizer stuff works far batter (or maybe it's something else in the sanitizer)."
I‚Äôm no expert in fires but I‚Äôd be shocked if there wasn‚Äôt some accelerant used. Maybe high-proof alcohol or something? The article suggested the victim was declared dead at the scene. That seems like a veryy quick engulfing
"She was sleeping, per the article. It's also cold out, so if you're bundled up in layers, and someone sets your jacket on fire in a few places, it'll take a bit for the fire to get down to your bottom layer and wake you up, and then it would take you too long to get it off."
"Holy shit, sounds like it, per the article:

>The video downloaded from the subway car showed the suspect setting alight a blanket the victim wore, and the fire expanded until the victim stood up while engulfed in flames‚Ä¶

>The person who set the victim on fire appeared to retreat from the train car, sit on a bench at the station and watch as the victim stood and burned, according to Miller."

I couldn't find an article if there was any resolution. The visibly poor are victims of random violence that seems to be recorded as a footnote."
"The article states very little about how he committed the act:

> Police believe the suspect **used a lighter to ignite the victim‚Äôs clothing**, ‚Äúwhich became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,‚Äù Tisch said.

> The video downloaded from the subway car **showed the suspect setting alight a blanket the victim wore**, and the fire expanded until the victim stood up while engulfed in flames

I'm curious what blanket material could be so easily ignited with only a lighter.

u/PmButtPics4ADrawing mentioned liquor bottles, which I was able to verify from another article:

> She was found with liquor bottles surrounding her, though it was not immediately clear if they played any part in the fire, sources told the New York Post.

I imagine we'll know more in the coming days when they review the subway footage.

I feel sad for anyone to have to endure such a traumatic end and without provocation."
she was sleeping

"Its got to be the worst pain imaginable

Anyone thats ever had a second degree burn (which is probably the vast majority of  people alive if youre old enough) can just imagine that across the entire body

Thinking a little more deeply its probably the worst thing possible and then the burns get so severe that the nerve endings die and the pain mostly goes away if you last long enough.....theres probably a massive shock response involved that will also dull the pain, i imagine

It‚Äôs an indefinite prison sentence served in a psychiatric jail until doctors deem the person ready to be released and they must undergo lifelong restrictions and monitoring after that.
"NCR is not the same thing as 'not guilty' in Canada. NCR means you're going into a psychiatric ward, sometimes for even longer than you would go into jail. He's not being let out any time soon."
Honestly in these cases they often end up locked up for longer in psych wards than they would in prison

"This is making so deeply sad. As a nurse who used to work nights I‚Äôd regularly doze off too and from work. I‚Äôm not homeless, just didn‚Äôt adjust well to working nights. This is so vile.

"she was asleep on the bench at the final stop where the train sits for 10-15 mins and gets wiped down. they usually kick everyone off but often the homeless stay on the bench asleep.

She was most likely a homeless woman trying to sleep somewhere warm as it is cold here"

"The type of homeless to walk around setting people on fire needs involuntary hospitalisation either indefinitely or until such a time when they can be trusted to take their pills and operate in society. It is incredibly difficult to actually do this for schizophrenics and anti-asylum campaigns rendered it politically toxic to change this. It doesn't matter if there are enough shelter beds because these people are mentally ill and need serious medical help, they will still wander out of shelter places and do this. Countries that don't have the crazy homeless problem don't have so many barriers in place to institutionalise for example in the UK you have to argue your way *out* of a hospital after being sectioned while in the US the state has to keep you in long term. This is also why you hear stories of people being committed after ringing suicide hotlines, the state can lock you up on public safety grounds for short term but has to let you out and then take you to court and win to lock you up long term."
It‚Äôs more terrifying than what Luigi did
No. It‚Äôs genuine terrorism. He targeted her because she was sleeping  in public (ie. homeless)
I saw the video on twitter it looks like a group of people just watched her burn alive
Hey now don't let the truth get in the way
"The definition of terrorism isn‚Äôt something terrifying, it‚Äôs the use of violence against non-combatants to achieve political or ideological aims. A business executive is not a combatant, and his killer clearly had political/ideological motives."
Whoa he's such a badass
"I may be a total dork, but at least I can rest easy knowing I'm never gonna be half as much of a goober as Eric Adams is."
Adams has his own perp walk coming up!  Looking forward to it. Wanna look him in his eyes.
"There's a version of this statement that's sincere, coming from someone who takes responsibility for and wants to protect the city he's been given authority over. ...That version can't come from Eric Adams."

He thinks his badass words will get him a pardon.
They‚Äôre so out of touch
Eric Adams knew about those sexual assault and harassment for years. And he defended it. The only reason Maddrey stepped down was because Adams's indictments make it harder to defend.
"It must have been. Probably a crazy person or partner. Regardless, the person who did this sounds much more dangerous than Luigi so I am sure the full might of the law will vome down on them."
"No, the victims net worth is likely less than 9 figures, so it‚Äôs just an unsolvable case"
Link to video? Not because I would actually want to see this horrible tragedy but because having proof that a cop walks past her is pretty damning and should result in a very strong response against the officer
"WHAT THE FUCK


What is wrong with EVERYONE in that video?!"
What the actual fuck?
"I mean, benefit of the doubt, is the cop looking for an extinguisher?  He def looks like he gets on his radio."
"so what do you expect the cop to do in that situation? like fr. all he can do is secure the area to keep people away and try to maybe find a fire extinguisher - not that it would have helped or done anything. someone at that point of immolation is dead, just the body hasn't shut down yet."
"Jesus Christ. Ask and you shall receive, I guess. What a horrible, horrible act."
People on Twitter should be Tweeting this to FBI/NYPD asking what the reward is.
Don't forget about all the K9 units. Gotta deploy the full force of the NYPD and neighboring police districts.
What about the police scuba divers in Central Park!?!??!!???
They care about money
"There seem to be a lot of serial murders and other targetted killings of homeless people. It makes me wonder if cities like NYC consider it a net positive, since it means fewer people living on the streets."
"They already arrested him, seems pretty efficient"
They should be commended for their actions
"Wait what? I haven‚Äôt seen the video & don‚Äôt want to, but there were witnesses watching as this person stumbled around on fire? No attempt to put her out?"
"That's what's crazy to me. The guy who set her on fire sitting on the bench and watching her burn is bad enough, but you'd obviously kind of already written him off as a psychopath. But the cop - wtf?! The fact that he had *no* reaction is shocking to me. Standing there shellshocked, okay. Freaking out and not knowing what to do, okay. But walking by as if nothing at all was going on? Can't fathom"
"I would imagine a little bit of shock, a lot of opening your mouth/inhaling to scream when you're engulfed in flames probably makes it even worse"
"the post you replied to is reddit in a nutshell, couldn't summarize it better"
People were way more angry about scenarios they made up in their head than about the woman who was SET ON FIRE AND MURDERED.
The guy is already in custody.  People just running with made up narratives here. Lol
Social media is like 90% shadow boxing now.
"People seem to think detective work is done by all cops and is like CSI where there's always a lead and if the mayor doesn't say anything, they aren't doing anything."
You‚Äôll find lots of dorks on Reddit support the murder of the insurance CEO and are mad New York devoted lots of resources to arresting the murderer. So now they‚Äôre making up nonsense like this because they want to make the NYPD look bad.
They like to make shit up in their heads then get mad at that.
"Yeah, if they have a manifesto talking about how they hate women. Idk why everyone acts as if this is comparable"
What do you think the definition of terrorism is?
Ha! Rich people don't take the subway
Do we know that she was killed for political purposes?
"A random person burning someone they don't know is way more dangerous to the general population, than a person who kills someone specific for a reason.¬†"
Looks like it already got solved
They already have him in custody.¬†
It's pretty likely they were the only 2 on that car that early on a Sunday at a terminus station.  Guessing it was a homeless woman that was attacked.
Hence Charles Bronson. FYI Death Wish (1974) is a great movie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Wish_(1974_film)
"Have you considered becoming an insurance CEO? If not, that's on you.¬†


(But on a serious note, I'm sorry that happened to you.)"
"Depends on your time frames. In the early 90s? Yes 10x worse. ~2005-2016, way better than now."
"Bro take the London, Tokyo, or Indonesian subway. 

New York has a fucking problem, no fucking reason to put up with it."
"Hahaha without incident is a stretch. 

Most people don't get seriously physically injured, correct.  Lots of 'incidents' happen every day though.  Source: take the subway regularly to get to work."
"Serious question, forgive me if it's dumb, are there normally fire extinguishers on subway cars? I grew up on Long Island and went to NYC a lot as a kid, but it's been at least a decade since I last rode the subway and I don't remember them having fire extinguisher boxes like schools or stores have."
Having taken the F train I can confirm that thing has a very long route and is frequently pretty damn empty. It also doesn‚Äôt run super often
"I was EMS in NC almost a decade ago now.  We could declare death, but it had to be obvious injuries incompatable with life.  Otherwise we take em in as alive."
Yeah we make pronouncements on scene all the time. This person doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. You don‚Äôt take every obviously dead person to a Dr.  That‚Äôs ridiculous
"In NY EMS can declare death but only in specific circumstances where it is visible and incontravertible. So no if they cant find a pulse, yes if there is lividity or their brain is outside of their skull."
"Virtue-signalling opportunity of a lifetime. Horrible, tragic way to die? Yes, perfect opportunity to release my snarky comment about the unrelated CEO shooting."
She had a walker and had been burning for too long already...
Bold of you to assume most people in this thread actually read the article.
Why are the feds involved? Because he left the state?
"Yeah, but the federal government does. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre hitting Luigi with terrorism charges."
"Regular 80 proof liquor isn't reliably flammable, that's why I specified high proof. Around 100 is where it starts to ignite more easily"
"I'd put money on her coat being an accelerant. It says she was sleeping, and it's full on winter in New York - so good chance of coat.


And I don't think people realize how fast a cheap synthetic material coat will burn. And the worst part of it is, you're only going to have seconds to take it off before it starts to melt on your body, or for the zipper to become unusable. 


This actually makes me really nervous to think about.


Edit: it's been confirmed the suspect only had a lighter. But the woman may have been wrapped in a synthetic blanket rather than a coat."
"seen the videos/pictures it was more than just her on fire, floor around her was on fire too. there was accelerants."
Horrific attack but a small mercy at least that she hopefully didn't have to suffer for long. I can't imagine there's much worse than having to live with such painful burns over a significant part of your body. Can only hope that the cowardly prick who did this to her ended up burned as well in the process.
Especially if you're wearing synthetics. Many types of synthetics are very flammable and once they're set on fire they quickly melt into your skin so that they're almost impossible to take off.
Hopefully that‚Äôs the case and she died from smoke inhalation before the fire even got to her body.
"That sucks. No one likes traveling via busses and stuff. If the person was sleeping they were tired. Either tired going somewhere, or coming from somewhere. All of it is a horrible event, horrible way to go. Just horrible.¬†"
"Yes - there was a big PSA in the UK decades ago about being careful with the (then) new fabric being used for nightclothes that was brushed nylon (I think it was called?) Seeing as a hell of a lot of households back then had either an open fire or electric/gas fires, there were some horrific accidents. The material just melted to the person's skin.

I'm seeing it through the lens of a newly-brought-back memory, naturally, so bear with me - that was the gist of it though.  I think the only other major PSAs I can remember from then were about crossing the roads, and about firework handling."
"Yeah, this on top of how natural flammable our own hair is with the oils and such, sleeping on a train an being caught off guard and no aid from others most would be overwhelmed"
"I was a stupid kid once( still stupid just not a kid anymore) and played with fireworks to be the cool kid. 

Doctors said I had a guardian angel that I didn't lose my hands just had severe 3rd 2nd and 1st degree burns to both my hands and man.... lemme tell you. The pain traumatized me. 

I don't fuck with fire anymore. It's a different kind of internal pain. I can't imagine going out that way."
"He had a mason jar of lighter fluid and a lighter with him, deliberately stood next to the victim, asked her if she was from Tibet, and fled the scene of the crime. How in the world is that not premeditated murder with an understanding of right and wrong??"
The person who killed her was also Asian..

"I would never feel safe doing that, are you a man? I'm not trying to be snarky or a smartass. but as a woman, I wouldn't in a hundred years feel safe sleeping in public."
I used to work 3rd shift and would sometimes be tired and fall asleep and miss my stop.
r/Eyebleach
"Much more terrifying. A manhunt is needed to catch the killer as soon as possible. Anyone who can target the homeless in such a sick, sadistic and cruel way will likely strike again. The response from law enforcement to this killing will tell us all we need to know about where the average person falls in this justice system. Everyone needs to keep their eyes on this case."
the guy watching on the bench is the guy who did it to her.absolutely INSANE I hope they catch this guy and he gets hell. What a despicable piece of human waste. Fucking lunatic
I don't understand why the mayor wants to treat Mangione like a Bond villain. If he really wanted to discredit him he could've given him less attention.
/r/iamverybadass
Funny he says that to a guy chained up.
"Careful now, he might look you in the eyes and then you‚Äôll be sorry."
"I think the same thing, many times. I‚Äôm pretty awkward, occasionally, often saying shit that seems normal at the time, but regretting it later. I‚Äôm *still* not close to being as much of an asshole as the more clueless douchebags that have somehow managed to rise up in society."
"Still comes off as cowardly no matter the circumstance. r/iamverybadass material. Even if the guy is Hitler, what is posturing while he's in handcuffs while under police escort going to do? The only value is making yourself feel better, which is sad considering the power imbalance circumstances."
"This is fucking hilarious 

And true!"
It‚Äôs New York. They‚Äôd just arrest whoever tried to stop him.
Yes. All available NYPD officers will need to be present for the next photo shoot transporting Luigi.¬†
They already solved it buddy.
The public will be outraged for 30 min and the topic will fall off
"It‚Äôs on Twitter/X but hopefully gets posted elsewhere eventually

I don't want to fact check this either
Not that everyone sitting around isn‚Äôt disturbing but why isn‚Äôt she reacting either?
"It‚Äôs nyc man, idk what to tell you"
"Tbh, I think I would be too shocked to react. People online love to act like they'd jump in but in real life they most likely wouldn't. I know for a fact that as a woman who has been riding the subways on the reg since teenagehood, the best thing is to just get away from danger asap & go for help instead. The last thing you need to happen is for the guy who did this to come back & shove you into the fire along with the victim."
"Tbf, the only sane thing to do in that situation is to run for help. Even the cop is no use to the victim, and frankly I wouldnt be stepping anywhere near that train either. That said, to sit there doing nothing, to walk past like nothing is wrong on your morning beat cop, and just standing there recording the incident are all fucking insane actions to take. If you are going to be useless at least turn to survival instincts and run the fuck away from that situation..."
Article said $10k ü´†
Hey so what did they do with any evidence they found doing that dive? They following up on those cases or...
"I'm not condoning the behavior, but I can give a glimpse into the apathy.  

From my experience, these cops have very little power in which they can impact big societal change on an individual basis (unless they kill someone).  It's very easy to get jaded as a cop, especially when you've put your effort into something before and then you get stonewalled by bureaucracy, ""the system"", or the limitations in which you can provide assistance.  This shit can bleed into how you conduct yourself on routine shit every single day.  When you're arresting the same person month after month after month, it becomes routine at some point.  That person will either *finally* get their shit together, leave the city, or die.  The public safety apparatus is **incomplete** and over worked.

Consider the de-criminalization of drugs in Portland.  Great idea in concept that was predicated on the success of the continued support system the people would have access to.  Guess what they didn't get?  The second part that's actually meant to directly help them.

Either way, the department I work with in a civilian capacity does a decent job at rotating officers off patrol and into other areas just to mix it up for them, especially if it's apparent they are slipping.  We've let numerous officers go in recent years of conduct unbecoming of an officer, but that's not exactly something that is advertised to the public.  I wish that tarnished record can travel with them via an official document, but that's a different battle.

To the subject of homeless people getting killed, it's just... hard sometimes when the people you're investigating don't have any record and the pool of people who could be pissed at them could literally be anybody else in the homeless community who also are hard to keep track of.  It's not like a dispute between neighbors or known associates with relatively stable lives where you can poke and prod at irregularities."
"Not sure why you were downvoted. I've seen it and I don't want anyone else to have to see it if they don't want to, so I'll answer. he guy who set her on fire is sitting on a bench and watching her burn. The guy recording the video is standing a ways behind them and freaking out, but beyond that doing nothing but recording the video. Then a literal cop walks by, turns his head and clearly sees this woman standing there on fire, and has no reaction. He keeps walking. Everything in this video is absolutely insane."
I wish I didn't see it. The only thing I can imagine with the cop is maybe the heat from the flames was burning his eyes and he couldn't make out that she was standing there alive? I haven't been that close to such a large fire. I also dont understand the person filming not doing more. It seems like someone could've tried to pull her out and roll her or something. It's awful
"I just can‚Äôt imagine having the will power not to scream, it‚Äôs disturbing she was able to walk around. It sounds horrible but it would have been better if she like‚Ä¶ never woke up or something. What an awful way to die"
Gotta love it when people BS a narrative only to be proven completely wrong.
In NYC they absolutely do.
You wouldn't believe.
There's actually a joke that in Manhattan things are reversed and the rich people commute on the subway while the poor people drive to work
"don‚Äôt bother. these people don‚Äôt want to read, or critically think for that matter"
But that doesn‚Äôt fit our agenda
"There is a video. Other than the suspect, there are at least 2 people. One of them just filmed it."
Thank you. I have a lifelong TBI but fortunately meds help to where I can work full-time (though not as an insurance ceo lol).
"no, there are not fire extinguishers in the subway cars, nor are they obviously placed in stations."
"They are talking about the requirements for declaring dead being a lot.

In most places the only things that can allow for dead on scene is lividity, decapitation, putrefaction and such.

People get brought into burn center with absolutely horrific burns all the time without being declared dead at scene."
I don‚Äôt think you can discount the person for suggesting it had to be pretty horrific for the deceased to be pronounced on scene. It varies state to state what the protocol is but i‚Äôve transported some horrific stuff just to have them be pronounced at the hospital.
"This is literally what everyone is wondering. And if the feds are involved, why is NY still involved?? They‚Äôre both charging him with the same stuff, it‚Äôs weird."
"Yes. Also little fun fact: You actually don‚Äôt even need to leave the state for the feds to get involved. They just need to have reasonable suspicion that you have left the state to go after you. IE: You commit a crime in Illinois and have strong family ties in North Carolina. The FBI can then fill out a warrant for ‚ÄúFleeing the state to avoid prosecution‚Äù and go after you, even if you haven‚Äôt left the state."
for those that don't know proof is half of the percentage.  100proof is 50% alcohol
Yeah my mom was wearing a Tommy puffer jacket and stood too close to a hot dog roller machine at my nieces birthday party and the jacket began to melt. Cheap synthetic fabrics are no joke.
"I used to wear a Spiderman Halloween costume all the time as a young child, and i still remember my parents being like ""DONT go anywhere near the fire pit"" (a party or something was happening) and of course being a stupid kid prolly said something like ""I'll go jump in the pool"" and they're like ""no it will melt to you"""
"Also, some fabric softeners make clothing more flammable."
New fear unlocked.
"It's the sort of terrifying thing a copycat could easily re-enact if it was the coat .

The monster that did this needs to be locked up forever"
I have a shearling coat for when it‚Äôs really cold but my standard otherwise is heavy duck cotton with a Sherpa fleece lining - I‚Äôve never really appreciated until now that I haven‚Äôt ever had to worry about catching fire in it.
"This is what I wish we'd do to these fuckers. Do to them what they did to their victims. He deserves to slowly burn to death cause wtf is this shit man. Now he'll be locked up, but he'll be fed and clothed and given more opportunities than that poor homeless woman ever had. Shit infuriates me."
"Often times they suffocate not from smoke, but because all of their alveoli in their lungs burst so they can no longer exchange air properly.

When they try to breathe, they breathe in the extremely hot air and fire, which burns all the tissue from your mouth to lungs. Once the alveoli are destroyed, you are doomed and practically nothing can save you, even immediate medical attention. So they are able to take breaths, but no air exchange happens. Intubation does nothing even if you are given pure oxygen since gas exchange is impossible. The oxygen/CO2 needs to be exchanged through your blood cells directly which is only possible in a hospital, but you won't live long enough to make it there. It's called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."
It's very probable that he will never leave that hospital. The 'sentences' of the violently insane are often longer than those of regular murderers.
"You could do all of the above because a voice in your head tells you to. Even if he was sane and intentionally spent months pretending to be insane on trial, he now has to spend the rest of his life institutionalized with people who are ALSO violent and mentally ill. Honestly, regular prison would likely be better for a sane person so I'm leaning towards him being mentally ill."
"He has a decade of documented display of psychosis (left as undiagnosed overall) and obsession with Tibet politics.  His doctors also documented that he said he wanted to set himself on fire, presumably copying Buddhist protest.  The insane guy probably was told not to do that and being the insane person that he is did it to someone else."

"I've seen men and women fall asleep on the train before. Usually it's not a choice, they're just so exhausted that they fade out."
I've dozed off on the train and I'm a woman. I was working crazy retail hours and sometimes it wasn't a choice as much as a necessity.
"I'm a woman and I fall asleep on the train too. Not on purpose, of course. After a long day you just kinda doze off"
The guy was arrested.
">The response from law enforcement to this killing will tell us all we need to know about where the average person falls in this justice system


We already know.¬†"
They already got they guy. Do you have what you need to know ? What does that tell you.
Mayor Eric Adams is in some serious legal hot water and the entirety of his activity as mayor right now is dedicated to sucking up to Trump for a potential pardon and for sucking up to the wealthy owner class who can insulate him from legal repercussions. That's all it is.
He cast himself as Temu Commissioner Gordon.
The oligarchs have been deranged and want to make an example of him. I wouldn't be shocked if they tried for a public execution.
To take the heat off himself due to all the corrupt shit he's into.
It helps him seem less corrupt and pretend mayor Eric adams isn't the bond villain himself.
"He‚Äôs projecting because he‚Äôs the real criminal.

Anything to take the attention off him ig"
Does he have the Penance Stare? Is Adams a Ghost Rider?
So true
"Hey now, guarding the christmas tree on Times Square takes up at least a third of active duty officers."
"That is shocking, can't believe I just saw that. RIP, what an awful way to die."
Not to mention the bystander sitting on the bench just watching...
"How is she so calm while burning? At first I assumed that she was already dead, but then she moved a bit."
"Person opining on the incident on X having big opinions about people not being able to help a victim literally burning while informed by video created by someone who whipped out their cell phone. 

Good sign of humanity all around."
"Reacting appropriately in an emergency is a skill that can be taught. If you think you would freeze and then regret it later, I suggest looking into bystander training, deescalation training, first aid training, etc."
That‚Äôs the same amount from NYPD as it was for Luigi.
That‚Äôs so sad. It‚Äôs hard to understand how we have moved past what should be an instinctive reaction to help to simply documenting the event or walking past for help. I guess the officer is probably trained to get someone who handles fires but still.
"The cop was looking for a fire extinguisher. It was mentioned in an article, and you can see him use his walkie for a second. There isn't much else he can do, but scout for the suspect. It's not like he can stop the woman from burning alive with his bare hands."
People acting Like theyre just gonna let this guy run free because the Vicim isnt a billionaire.¬†
"I mean the video I saw was filmed from outside the car and well past the point where they could help. That being said I don't think I could sit, literally sit and watch anyone burning alive in front of me."
"‚ÄúInjuries incompatible with life‚Äù is often the term used when cpr would obviously have zero chance of working. 

They need to be careful though, I remember hearing about some woman in a car crash EMT pronounced dead, then the coroner showed up hours later in the freezing cold and found her found alive with weak pulse but it was too late by then and she actually died but likely wouldn‚Äôt have with prompt treatment."
They get brought to the burn center because they‚Äôre still alive. That‚Äôs the difference.
"The Feds are involved because he crossed state lines.

>They‚Äôre both charging him with the same stuff, it‚Äôs weird.

Why his lawyer will be arguing double jeopardy."
"Expensive synthetic fabrics, too. I""m pretty sure a Patagonia synthetic semipoof is going to do pretty much the same thing."
Imagine that hot plastic dripping on you. Ouchhh.
It's all fun and games until someone suggests your clothes will melt to you
I always knew I was doing a good thing by not ever using fabric softener!
Well that‚Äôs horrible
They let that guy who decapitated someone on a bus free
It's also just kind of a basic math type of assumption that he's more likely to be mentally ill than smart enough to successfully trick numerous individuals with degrees whose job it is to figure out if he is mentally ill.

"I remember going home late one night and this woman and her young elementary aged daughter were clearly extremely exhausted (maybe homeless?) and at one point the daughter slumped over asleep onto MY lap (I am also a woman) and the mom was totally out. It was kind of cute but mostly horrifying because if I had been any kind of bad stranger the mom would be totally clueless to her daughter‚Äôs situation. You‚Äôre right, any normal person would choose to NOT to fall asleep but whatever their situation was their bodies were just done with the day."
Hey bro reddit was trying to champion a communist revolution and you are ruining it ok
Hey¬† SHUT UP. SHUT THE FUCK UP I'm trying to form a strawman argument in an echo chamber on the Internet and I literally do not have to acknowledge your counterpoint!
They already have the guy so what do you mean you know
I'm shocked at just how bad of a mayor he is. A shame to all democrats and anyone with a shred of human decency.
The origin story of every NYC mayor
‚ÄúTemu Commissioner Gordon‚Äù got me.
It‚Äôs hilariously pathetic how transparent they‚Äôve been about this. They could have such better image management by doing less but it‚Äôs like they can‚Äôt fucking help themselves.
"No, they would just create more
Luigi‚Äôs in doing so"
"For those that don't know, Eric Adams has been indicted on five federal charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud, two counts of solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national, and bribery. He's also been accused of sexual assault and had several high-profile resignations within his administration. Nothing has been proven yet, but all signs point to him being a corrupt politician who would absolutely use Magione as a scapegoat to curry favor with the people of New York."
Well it's backfiring because he's only making Luigi more relevant and him looking like a bigger fool. If he really wanted to lessen the damage he just needs to let it go and face the consequences since no matter what he's going to get charged.
I think he‚Äôs the guy who did it.
Supposedly that was the guy that lit her on fire.
And the person who just stood filming.  WTF is up with people??
"I would assume she was in going into/had already gone into shock, which can look like calmness."
"Fire will kill the nerves so she didn't feel anything past a certain point. At that point she was already dead.

I'm surprised she is still conscious by this point.

Esit: physically didn't feel anything. I am not familiar enough with being burned alive to know how much shock would alter her consciousness... but it's really depreasing to think ger last moments were surrounded by people who could have prevented her death, but didn't. Wtf is wrong with people?"
"From what I've read on other places, she was asleep when he set her on fire and also surrounded by empty liquor bottles, so perhaps not in a coherent state of mind. Plus I imagine at a certain point of being on fire you kind of lose touch"
it's the same amount for pretty much every murder.
It's called the Dual Sovereignty doctrine. There's no double jeapordy here.
IANAL but I‚Äôm pretty sure double jeopardy means you can‚Äôt be tried for the same crime after you‚Äôve been acquitted in a first trial.
"Dual jurisdiction, IANAL but AFAIK you can be charged with a federal crime and a state crime for the same act."
Double jeopardy requires you to be acquitted or convicted of a crime and then persecuted a second time for the same crime to apply.
Yup. Didn't know my $400 Northface jacket was melting/burning till I saw all the down stuffing floating over our fire pit. That was from radiant heat.
Just happened to my Patagonia

"I've worked in forensic psychiatry. It's not taken lightly letting people out at all, nor is finding someone to have reduced culpability. Every aspect of their lives is controlled for years, far beyond what would occur in a prison.

You would not choose it if you had the choice between that or a regular sentence."

It's delightful to hear a story of people surviving, for a change."

Hello recurring nightmare.
The word ''cracks'' in this context is a head-scratcher.
Wow those ski patrol workers are the heroes.
"I've been on the gondola out of necessity, but am terrified of heights. 

Winter Park and Grand County have a lot of great activities. Hot springs, a cool museum, nice restaurants. Awesome place to spend a few days."
Oh neat! Do modern lifts sense changes in cable tension and shut down if there is an event?
That my favorite place to visit.
"Sorry that can‚Äôt be true, it‚Äôs my understanding that ski lifts are uncrackable. Indestructible. Impervious to the elements and to the sands of time. It is not possible in this physical universe for one to break with people on it.  Thank you."
Imagine waiting 5 hours to be rescued from a ski lift. Thank you for this nightmare fuel!
Them white neighhoods can be dangerous¬†
Why was it important to separate skiers and snowboarders in the article? Thankfully there were no people sledding as that would have drastically changed the whole situation.
I live here. Talk of the town.
My friend is a patroller at WP. They got pizza. I'm serious. He was actually pretty happy about it though.
Best they can do is give the CEO of the ski resort a bonus for their leadership.
They won‚Äôt
"It's their job. Like great props to the patrollers, it's one of the things you train for, but it's just a day at the job."
For real! Took 5+ hours. Bet nobody gets paid extra.
"If it‚Äôs a Vail owned resort, they‚Äôll probably try and cut the patrollers pay."
"They lowered the equipment out first.  

Like, I‚Äôm not sitting in a stranded gondola while skis/poles/snowboards are being ferried to the ground.  Get the people out first *then* lower the shit down.  

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some logistical reason they do it this way that I‚Äôm not smart enough to understand - but the optics just seem wonky."
"This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen Fascinating Horror mentioned outside of YouTube, which is crazy considering they have 1.26m subs"
Isn't that the guy who just reads Wikpedia articles?
Or Plainly Difficult
"When you see one you can't help but wonder about the rest.

And how in the hell did they repair that in one day?  Replace the entire truck, or bogey or whatever you want to call it with a new one?"
"Try it in places like Angel Fire in the off season without snow..... 

I needed extra anxiety meds to take the lift and my bike up"
"I can't post pictures in this sub but I'll DM you one if you want, I took a picture of it before they repaired it today. It's a big ol crack."
"Yes, they do. The tension has a certain threshold. If it drops too low, you risk the haul rope bounching out of the shiv wheel. In modern lifts, there is an electric sensor that will trip if things get out of whack or the counterweight starts getting weird. 

Having worked in lift ops before lift infrastructure is generally reliable and tested daily (at least where I worked), including testing the backup engines, stops and emergency stops, power outage, etc. However, these are mechanical devices and can fail. That said, a full evac on a gondola is almost unheard of, and I'm sure there will be an investigation into how this happened and if any personnel missed the signs of this disaster."
Yes. Modern ones also enormous counterweights and the ability to take up a surprisingly large amount of slack if the cable comes off a tower or something similar. From an engineering standpoint the tension and available cable slack is actually changing all the time as people are getting on and off.
Watch the movie frozen
Why would anyone downvote this? Are there people out there who get off on being stuck on a chairlift hahaha wtf
"Yeah, I patrolled for 10 years starting around 1999. We lived for that sorta stuff. Tons of ropes work, rapping scared guests down to safety, nobody hurt? Yeah baby!

And then _pizza_?!  Hell yeah!

The most fun I ever had was self-evac'ing from a ""broken down"" double before helping clear the rest of the ""guests"" (other patrollers ""stuck"" on the lift) during annual refresher training.

I carried a heavy rope and rappelling gear in my pack all those years just for that one time üòÇ It did actually happen at our mountain once, but I wasn't on duty that day, dang it!"
That CEO wears the best helmet on the mountain
Yeah whatever the pay arrangements that‚Äôs most definitely not a *typical* day at that job though üòÇ
It certainly wasn‚Äôt. The gondola goes over some very difficult terrain for your average skier. I imagine that it was not easy to belay people down onto that grade because they would be essentially standing on one leg for hours. That would be super difficult.
It's not. Most people say it's owned by Alterra but Alterra runs it on behalf of the city of Denver who actually own it.
"You need to get down the mountain, ski and board really help."
"Well, you're on a slope. Better to get the equipment down and then people, so as each is lowered, they can move on. Don't need all these people milling about waiting on equipmentment. It just makes logical and logistical sense to do it the way they did."
"Most skiers and snowboarders are not gonna leave their gear up there. They can represent sizable financial investments, so it makes sense to lower all the gear and get the people out after making sure they can have all their stuff and go on their way immediately without wanting to come back or wait around to make sure their stuff is coming down promptly."
"Maybe you should head out there and tell them how to do their jobs in person. It loses a little something coming from the internet. 

Signed, an old professional ski patroller."
"Once the people are down, who's going to hand down their stuff? lol"
One would assume you just drop your gear the 30ft or so
"It‚Äôs already repaired?!?  I remember reading comments like ‚Äúoh boy, this repair is going to take a long time‚Ä¶‚Äù"
Me too please.¬†
"Like one of the pylons cracked? I am curious.

Edit: Saw a photo, that crack is worse on second look. That part is holding the whole wheel carriage system on that pylon. I am surprised they have supposedly already repaired it. That is wild."
Please send me pics too!
"Would also love to see it, thanks"
A crack in *what* though? That's still not giving us any context.
I also would like Photos
Are you still showing pictures? I'd love to see what that looked like
I'd like that.
Now I can't get that damn Let It Go song out of my head¬†
Yeah honestly he had a great time. But we still gotta support our patrollers better! Park City ski patrol union is on strike for better wages and treatment! Anyone reading this go support or patrollers! @/pcskipatrolunion on IG!
"Im literally a patroller. We train for full gondi evacs. Whether its rope or heli assist, we train the full length of the gondi. And yes, it's 100% a normal requirement that is routinely drilled so everyone is fresh. Last thing you want is unprepared patrollers with a full, broken down gondi. Lives could be lost if unprepared."
No shit. Walking out in boots would blow.
"Also to add to this as someone who goes snowboarding and has been to Winter Park multiple times. 

They take up a lot of room and it would‚Äôve been more dangerous to try and get people set up to be lowered with skis, poles, and snowboards taking up space. 

Some have them on the outside of the door which would make it dangerous for the people below receiving the rescued people, a snowboard/ski/pole falling down could kill someone."
Same goes for your luggage etc in an evacuation but you're still told to leave it.
The ski patrol that are still in the gondola?
Absolutely not
Yup started loading it about 20 minutes ago!
Good welders can really burn an incredible amount of rod.
Sent chat invite
"Yeah pretty crazy! And as of about 20 minutes ago it's loading, so we're fully operational again!"
Chat invite sent
"Sent you a chat invite, need to accept before I can send pictures for obvious reasons"
I don't know what the part is but it's a foot thick beam over the wheels towards the base. Major component. Cracked almost clear through. It's pretty serious. But they just started loading it so we're fully operational again!
"Sent you a chat invite! Can't send pictures until you accept, for obvious reasons."
Yeah DMed you
Wrong movie!
"We trained over the toughest part of the hill here in Ohio, doing 80' from chair to ravine bottom. Never had a rescue called on that one, but toughest one I did was the side-by-side lifts (both inside up, outside down,) which were crazy difficult to shoot the lines for, I'll tell you what."
"You can always tell when people don't give a fuck at their jobs. They always just assume that everyone else fucks off and doesn't give a rats ass about doing their duty.

Nah, bro. Some people actually put in the fucking work to be prepared."
"Oh absolutely didn‚Äôt even think of that, I love winter park, and hope the gondola is fixed soon!"
I‚Äôd think there‚Äôs a difference between an active evacuation such as a fire or sinking ship and a stationary stuck gondola that they are slowly going around and bringing people down from.
I think plane evacuations are more time sensitive usually¬†
"Ok, so what's the accomplishment here with your order of operations? You get to leave the gondola 5 minutes sooner....to stand on the trail without your gear, waiting for the gear to be roped down, and you still don't get down the mountain any sooner.

Also, the gondola cabin is far warmer than standing around on the trail is, obviously."
Put me in brother.
"Seriously, have worked in multiple industries from well to shit paid, but there were always useless people alongside people who were absolutely amazing at what they do. Most of the complaining came from the useless."
"To be fair it‚Äôs been 2 years since I last was there and couldn‚Äôt 100% remember so I added it second. But yea my mind first went to trying to unload 6 people with all their gear still in the gondola.

Edit:
I said multiple because I‚Äôve been there 8 times in 2 trips. I was lazy to look at the gondola picture when I wrote the comment and my brain decided to not remember even though I saw the videos and articles lol."
"What a strange way to report war crimes.

Every other paragraph found a way to blame ""The West"" for failing to prevent war crimes across the planet.

The death squads are funded and armed by Rwanda.

Here is a statement from the UN Security Council explaining why they sanctioned these killers.

How about African intervention in Africa??? Got enough counties with sufficient firepower to set up their own intervention force....

Who is exporting coltan despite not having any of their own reserves?"

"Children had their skulls crushed. A reminder other very nasty conflicts exist in the world, not just one or two that people get selectively concerned about."

"It's literally damned if we do, damned if we don't ."
"Off the top of my head, France, China and Israel provided weapons in Rwanda. China and Russia are heavily investing in Africa. I‚Äôm not up to date on international arms dealing, though"
Sometimes when i read about cases like this i imagine putting something infused with magic mushrooms. Of course I would never do it because I wouldn't know how the other would react in that state and my conscience doesn't want to carry with the guilt of someone getting harmed because of me or my ideas.
"The crises that continue to unfold across African countries, ranging from political instability to economic exploitation, can be traced directly to the legacy of Western colonialism. Colonial powers extracted vast natural resources from the African continent, including both its raw materials and human labor, leaving behind a deep well of environmental degradation, fractured societies, and disrupted cultural identities. These countries were plundered for their resources without regard for the well-being or sovereignty of their peoples. When Western colonial powers ultimately withdrew, they left behind political and economic systems that were neither equipped nor designed to support the development of functional, democratic institutions.

The problem here is short-term memory and disconnect for Western countries. We are not far removed from the atrocities committed in African countries, but we are geographically and politically distanced. A short look into history can tell quite an obvious story of why the West could presumably have some faults here. Instead of investing in the long-term prosperity of African nations, Western powers abandoned them after exhausting their natural wealth. They imposed foreign systems of governance, often through the lens of Christianity and Western values that sought to erase indigenous cultures and replace them with a monocultural worldview. When colonial rule ended, the void was not filled with true democratic structures or sustainable development plans. The result has been a legacy of political turmoil, corruption, and instability that continues to destabilize countries across the continent today.

Western countries, by prioritizing short-term gain over long-term well-being, are largely responsible for the dysfunctional political systems that plague many African nations. Moreover, these powers have failed to establish meaningful pathways for these nations to recover and build a self-sustaining future. This neglect has paved the way for neocolonialism, where external actors, both Western and non-Western, continue to exploit Africa's resources.

In recent years, countries like Russia and China have taken advantage of this void left by the West, stepping in with lucrative deals that further drain Africa‚Äôs remaining resources. These foreign powers, much like their colonial predecessors, are capitalizing on the continent‚Äôs wealth without any real commitment to the development or well-being of its people. In fact, their involvement often exacerbates political unrest, entrenches authoritarian regimes, and continues the cycle of resource exploitation.

The global crisis unfolding in Africa is not solely the result of internal failings within these nations; it is the consequence of centuries of Western exploitation and abandonment. Western countries have consumed vast amounts of Africa‚Äôs wealth, from raw materials to human labor, while simultaneously stifling the continent's ability to forge its own path to stability and prosperity. The consequences of this historical injustice are not confined to Africa alone. They ripple across the globe, affecting global climate stability, economic inequality, and political unrest. The West, having benefitted disproportionately from Africa‚Äôs resources, must be held accountable for the ongoing exploitation that is preventing the continent from achieving true self-determination.

To move forward, it is essential to acknowledge the historical responsibility that Western countries bear for Africa‚Äôs plight. This recognition should be paired with concrete steps to repair the damage done by supporting genuine democratic reforms, fostering sustainable development, and ensuring that Africa's resources are used in a way that benefits its people, not foreign powers. Until this happens, the cycle of exploitation will persist, leaving African nations vulnerable to further economic and political crises, whether from Western nations or emerging powers like China and Russia.

**Disclaimer:** I ran this through an AI model for grammar and clarity - these are my genuine thoughts on the subject. That said, I do believe that Western countries suffer from short-term memory. It‚Äôs a recurring issue and a common notion that we tend to forget the longer, more painful history that continues to shape current events."

"REPHRASED: It‚Äôs remarkable how perspectives have shifted. In 2013, the West chose not to intervene in Syria after the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, with the UK Parliament voting against military action and the U.S. opting for a diplomatic solution to dismantle Assad‚Äôs chemical arsenal. The decision was largely influenced by concerns about getting entangled in another Middle Eastern conflict. Now, in 2024, the West faces criticism for its inaction, with some analysts arguing that the lack of intervention emboldened Putin, signaling a diminished Western resolve and paving the way for actions like the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine."
"If you‚Äôre damned if you do and damned if you don‚Äôt. Why do the thing that costs you people and money? In order to stabilize it you‚Äôd need military intervention. That would be seen as a western invasion, ultimately.

While sympathetic, I think most people in the west now have adopted a mindset of ‚Äúnot my backyard, I‚Äôll stay out of it.‚Äù"

If China, India or Russia involve themselves we will hear nothing or that they are the only ones who listen to the concerns of the third world. These people hate any western country and expect them to get every decision right every single time.¬†"
"I was about to click on the article and then read it‚Äôs from The Guardian. Told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù"
Average reporting from the Guardian
"This is why the U.S. told NATO they need to toughen up a couple years ago. We literally had to tell them to stop running to us for everything, as well as stop WAITING on us to respond before they respond. As a result they had their first joint exercise of over 300K troops for the first time in 20 years. Not because of our pep-talk. But because that was the greatest red flag our security leaders are unwilling to fulfill their NATO duties. Unfortunately, if you follow the timeline of the last 20 years, we've been on a fast downfall the past two decades since Putin's dictatorship began. This War in Ukraine revealed our country was definitely pulling tricks with Ukraine. We are the sole reason the War is still happening. Biden just approved Hungary & another country to resume purchases through sanctioned Gazprombank, for example. There's still billions promised to Ukraine sitting with Biden. He's waiting until the very last moment to release it & might not. On the battlefield the U.S. literally kept telling Ukraine they can strike Russia, then when they got some good hits; we told them to stop. Ukraine had to keep asking why their hands are being tied & we wouldn't give him a reason. Finally our top ranks admitted they wanted to have future relations with Russia. Also, everything Biden did was easily undone & will be undone. Even the chips manufacturing - China just cut us off ores. The only thing that wasn't undone or might not be is the investment in infrastructure. But that puts a lot of money right into state GOP hands; as evidenced by their bragging whenever they got the payments. My opinion, conspiracy theory, whatever; we got played by Biden very badly. Trump did have a few moments there he bragged they got Biden. It's one of those things he quickly quit talking about. I watched every single news conference wherein our security leaders were asked about Russia (& Israel). They're absolutely full attitude & never really answer."
I‚Äôm for military intervention to prevent crimes like these from happening.
"The West played a heavy role in Africa's political instability, but yes the direct responsibility for war crimes always rests on the people who choose to pull the trigger."

And no western country gives two shits about what happens in Africa unless it's an Islamic terrorist training ground. We've been in Africa for a long time killing Africans. Sure, we send them money too, but mostly we've sent them non-functional economies and political instability. Someday we will come for their water.¬†"

Awareness is great but the difference here is no one is posting Instagram stories praising the morality of M23 and kicking people out of universities for saying crushing children's skulls is bad. Uncontested atrocity is not a controversy.
"And yet here you are, using this horrifying conflict solely to try and draw attention back to the other ones that you care about more."

"I, too, thought of Israel immediately to when you mentioned crushing children's skulls.  Israel is  definitely in the child skull crushing category.

"Sorry, but the ones that think that something done in 2013 in Syria would've changed putin's plans don't know a thing. Maybe after Georgia in 2008, or before that, after Chechnya, but not in 2013. Heck, they had nazi training camps for Ukrainian youth back in 2004 or 2006 (named Seliger, but not sure if this is how it's spelled), not to mention that story with taking of Ukrainian island Tusla, or them delaying border demarcation till 2000s.

People should stop with all these weird ideas and consider that russia was never OK with the fall of USSR. If you look at the timeline, it becomes obvious that they invaded Ukraine as soon as they could: poverty and chaos in the 90s, wars in Chechnya up until late 2000s, then Georgia in 2008, then pro-russian Ukrainian president in 2010 was forcing Ukraine to join russia (was prevented by protests and followed by invasion of ""green men"" in 2014). There's also a declassified transcript of the meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin back in 1999 in Turkey where Yeltsin asked Clinton to give him Europe and said that he had a successor who will continue his work.

If anything, Europe/Merkel shouldn't have pushed Ukraine back into russia's embraces as it did, same as a century before that, or right after the fall of USSR."
"A lot of people don't care if the reasoning of why someone (or some nation) does something is correct.

They just want the result to be correct. In this case, they criticize the lack of intervention in the past because it would have prevented an atrocity now, but had the intervention occurred and something bad happened as a result, the same people would be saying the intervention never should've occurred.

Basically a good % of the general public only cares if the results or good or bad and basically want people/governments to be able to accurately predict the future."

To a lesser extent, i bet Mr. Putin feels that showing weakness to Russia would have gotten him killed (ex KGB thinking). Perhaps this may still come to pass? Syria is doing a LOT better since losing their Ass-Sad leader. 

My point: they live by optics, fine, but it is unnecessary suffering for everyone else."

Thank you. Iraq was a shit show but Lybia is still a civil war zone and a huge migrant fiunnel."
"The public mood should be utterly irrelevant. That way populism lies. We vote people in to do the job for us, they're the experienced politicians with all the advisors and information. The public are swayed by the press and socials, the government should not be paying any attention to what people ""want"", what if they wanted to bring back the death penalty, or kick all the brown people out.

"There are zero mentions of Western countries ""failing to prevent war crimes across the planet."" It specifically talks about them not preventing conflicts in former Western colonies, and the oppression is a key reason for why things today are the way they are.

Classic. Call the minorities racist when they point out white racism. You‚Äôre not fooling anyone with a brain.
"It was in the beginning of war and people were like ‚Äûhow can he say that‚Äú. Every major conflict impacts the world. Where do African refugees show up? Exactly, in Europe but no one here wants to see that. To be fair, the russian aggression is a bigger threat to Europe and the ‚Äûwest‚Äú in general."
"It can be both, you know. We can acknowledge that US/Western activities in the DRC, especially during the Cold War have caused long term harm to the country and also acknowledge that Western countries aren't the only reason the Congolese people are suffering so much. The CIA and Belgian backed assassination of the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the DRC, followed by US support for the dictators that followed did irreparable damage to generations of Congolese. It's also true that the Soviets were no better, and other African countries like Rwanda are also responsible for countless atrocities. It's true that many Congolese soldiers, warlords, politicians, generals, and so on are responsible for so much suffering inflicted on their own countrymen. We can acknowledge all of this, instead of playing this dumb game of defensively dismissing any faults of your ""team"" and pinning all of the world's evils on the other."
"I do not think the United States would be assisting Ukraine right now had they not signed a treaty exchanging their nukes for our protection.   Putin is annexing Georgia right now by seizing land and compromising politicians, and they're not getting bailed out.

If the nukes remained, Yanukovych might have even \*sold\* them to Russia.  They are expensive to maintain, after all.

Personally, when I called my member of Congress, I let them know I expected them to give Ukraine everything they need, or else no country will ever denuclearize again."
"I call him Ass-Hat.  

But yes you're totally right; optics, popularism etc. 

The problem politicians face today is endless scrutiny. But the bad actors in CRANK are now using that against us. They have people and bots trying to give some false equivalence to Putin's Russia and NATO. As if NATO is ""trying to expand"" rather than sovereign nations wanting to join a group in the face of an ex-KGB agent wanting to rebuild the USSR of his youth before he dies. 

My personal opinion is that Putin has made a massive mistake, China are fairweather friends, and his other allies are weak (Iran?? Syria?? NK??). The US and EU together are totally unstoppable in every type of warfare including cyber."
"Christians are being beheaded by former Al-Qaeda in Syria. Warlords are bring released from jail and Syria is being divided up by Turkey, Israel, and US-funded extremists. Nothing about what's happening in Syria is ""a LOT better"".

"i dunno, i think britain felt ambivalent about lybia- it's generally accepted Lybia  brought down the civilian airliner down on the town of Lockerbie so it felt good to see Gaddafi get his, there was a very big ""fuck them"" vibe, where iraq was just not our business."
"...If the will of the collective majority supports bringing back the death penalty and kicking all the ""others"" out, and a decisive vote supports this initiative, then I would fully expect the politicians to do what their constituents elected them to do.

"We lost soldiers in iraq, many to american friendly fire, for no real benefit

"I fear we're closer to more non-nuclear weapons states getting their own nukes than nuclear armed states willingly giving them up. I'm just hoping the years of nightshift, drug use, and heavy alcohol consumption kills me before they get used again."
"Well put, and thank you.

This helps me feel a bit better in these rather nasty times, though i am not entirely sure why."
So you‚Äôre suggesting Putin would have still invaded Ukraine if they had those nukes?
"China is, as China should be, learned from thousands of years of mistakes.

They have seen that anyone, East or West, will GLADLY stab them in the back the moment they are down. Now they are heniously opportunistic and, fuck us all sideways, *it has been working out extremely well for them*. Yes, they have a few billion problems, but the amount of success they have had lifting themselves partially out of poverty has been amazing.

Don't get me wrong, i am not here to praise China. But their plan of buying out ALL of Africa, Russia and anyone else who has put up a price tag on their lawn is quite clever. And i bet they learned most of it from the good old US of A at that."

You are right, and i am very sorry. It looks like the power vacuum has given the formerly oppressed minority the permission to slaughter anyone that isn't able to get their hands on guns. 

It looks quite horrible and that is from a safe distance. Glad i am not a part of this revolution thingy.

Edit: perhaps this opening paragraph makes you happier? *""Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs abrupt ouster and replacement by an Islamist-led transitional government has been greeted with both joy and caution.""*"

"Oh yes I agree Iraq was a disaster, I'm not saying the politicians are always going to make the right choices, but it's their choice to make, not some press baron, or an ill informed short-termist public mood.

My view on Iraq is that the info was bogus at best, and disinformation from the CIA at worst (not the US government, the CIA). What we should have done is rolled over Iran instead (but I'm just a member of the public..)"

"I didn‚Äôt address the entire continent of Africa. I addressed the Kivu and Ituri regions, which if there is any global power influence worth mentioning, it‚Äôs Chinese mining interests, not the West.

"Oh I don't think that, I think we've already seen how awful Brexit and the Tories were. Yes Labour only won (on less votes than Corbyn) because of the Tory/Reform split. But they themselves  were kept out of power becuase of a split on the left (Lib, Green, etc).

What we need is some real social ""reform"", where people feel safer, secure, and most of all healthier. The UK has always punched above its weight in innovation, social change, and related legislation. The world, including the US, are looking to the UK to bring in complex and well thought out legislation on things like the use of the internet by young people.

They executed him on his birthday.

I used to get scared of demons and spirits and entities as a kid but I am sure as hell more petrified of these kinda living breathing demons walking amongst us in the garb of a human being.
">""The decision to execute me on my birthday and six days before Christmas was a needlessly cruel thing to do to my family,"" Underwood said


Thats rich.

My question is, why does this take so long? Pyscho was on death row 17 years."
I grew up about 45 minutes from where this happened. I was a junior in high school. I remember it really clearly. They were searching for the victim for several days and this guy was helping out with the search effort.
"I'm not usually in favor of the death penalty, but his crimes are horrific. And evidently there is no question of his guilt. He certainly gave no mercy to the little girl he abused and killed. So in this case, it seems justified.¬†"
What in the Albert Fish
"I don‚Äôt support the death penalty, I‚Äôm also not going to shed a tear over this man being executed."
I listened to a podcast about this case and its one I think about ever now and then because of how cruel it was. Glad to hear this evil monster is no longer on earth and RIP to the poor little girl
"Rest in piss, sick fuck"
"This is why lawyers even fight for clemency for people like this:¬†

‚Äú¬†According to the¬†Death Penalty Information Center, 11 innocent people have been freed from Oklahoma's death row and seven clemencies have been granted in the state. After Underwood's execution, there are now 33 people on Oklahoma's death row, the center says.‚Äù

11. 11 fucking people were on death row and ended up being innocent. Imagine how many innocent people have been executed that were unable to have their case heard?"
"Well, this PoS has it coming. This scumbag is the poster child of why we have the death penalty. There is no question of guilt and the death penalty is the for sure way of removing him from society forever."

Well that was a horrible wiki to read. Jesus Christ.
"I'm still against the death penalty, and I disagree with all the crybabies having such emotional reactions to this, but damn this guy was evil."
"I have zero sympathy for killers, but as a rule, I don't agree with the death penalty. At least 4% of death penalties are found to be innocent. I don't agree with the government killing innocent people."
"At least this guy was guilty, it‚Äôs always crazy to me when they execute the innocent guys."
"I just read his wiki page and wish I didn‚Äôt have eyes üíÄ

But I‚Äôm still against the death penalty, even for this guy. We shouldn‚Äôt under any circumstance give our government the legal right to deprive any of its citizens of their lives, even the one who deserve it, even the ones who are more monster than human, even the ones who are a waste of space. Because it‚Äôs always a slippery slope."
I‚Äôm ok with this. Gotta get shit like this out of society.
"I don‚Äôt support the death penalty because I‚Äôd prefer these people suffer for every minute of the rest of their lives. The problem is that when we don‚Äôt execute them, their lives aren‚Äôt so bad ‚Äî all things considered. I don‚Äôt think I realized I support cruel and unusual punishment until I wrote out this comment."
Wow that guy was a real jerk .
His execution sparks joy. Deep in my justice bones.
I have no problem with this
State permit him to escape. Best was to spend his entire life in jail thinking on it.
"Good, too bad it took 18 years. Rest in hell."
I hope his last meal was 3-day old cold french fries and a glass of well water from a place that was fracked.
"Was the linked page the news article, or a script for a film noir? It started by giving a detailed account of what the condemned man experienced during execution."
I‚Äôm surprised he wasn‚Äôt beaten up in jail.
He deserves getting a small cut in the leg. Then dragged behind a boat in shark infested waters.
"Given the crime and the absolute truth that he is guilty: Why waste money feeding and housing him until his natural death? The girl had been shown no remorse, why should anyone else show him any?"
I'm not a supporter of the death penalty for a number of very good reasons. None of those reasons apply here. Fuck that guy. Throw his ashes in the nearest septic tank.
I hope he died with regrets and the knowledge he would never be able to make good on them. I hope he wasn't ready.
"I never thought I'd say this, but 'Hooray Oklahoma!'"
"1 gone, to many left to go"
His mom is garbage for asking for mercy. I wonder how many times the little girl asked for mercy.

This is why the death penalty should not be abolished.
Good - nite nite you POS.
lots of pro death penalty people ITT
"Deserved. Now, did they at least BBQ him and feed him to the pigs or at least some wild animals?"
I‚Äôm not a big death penalty fan but this is fine
"If you support the death penalty, you also unequivocally support killing innocent people. It's a guarantee that someone will be wrongfully executed, it's happened plenty already. So while what the guy did is obviously horrible, you grabbing your pitchforks and celebrating his execution, thereby approving the practice, means your dooming someone innocent in the future. You pretending that's not true doesn't change anything."
Saving this article for my ‚Äúabolish the death penalty‚Äù family & friends.
People like this should be tortured to death.
Good morning my mood in the morning
What did he get for a last meal?
"This is why we need olden days types of justice. After the guilty verdict, take them out back and execute them. Shame on him for trying to shame the justice system for killing him on his birthday 6 days before Christmas. How many Christmases did that poor girl‚Äôs family have without her? How many birthdays did she miss? Good riddance to trash."
2006! he should have been executed immediately for what he did.
Does the death penalty actually serve as a deterrent?
"I'm genuinely against the death penalty, but these are the types of cases it's reserved for.¬† Monsters. Truly, evil monsters.¬†"
He lived an integer number of years
Happy birthday to the ground.
I‚Äôm ok with this.
Happy birthday MF!

"How fitting. Sent back to Hell the day he came from it.

(Don't actually believe in Hell. But wouldn't mind these types of people going there if I did.)"
I hope they wished him a happy deathday.
Oh the honey is sweet
That‚Äôs really fucked up
Too late‚Ä¶uuuugh.
Did you know him very well?¬† Any stories that stand out in your mind?¬†
I will not lose any sleep over his passing.
"Per the guy from the linked article.

""The decision to execute me on my birthday and six days before Christmas was a needlessly cruel thing to do to my family,"" Underwood said, ""but I'm very sorry for what I did and I wish I could take it back.""

Fuuuck that guy."
"I remember this man! I think he went on to say how she wasn‚Äôt very attractive, balding, and such. Like what‚Äôs wrong with you?"
"No one is giving him sympathy. He's a terrible person who committed a terrible crime.

But the death penalty isn't only used against people like him. It has put down innocent people in the past and it will put down innocent people in the future. 

And I would rather have people like him rotting in jail for their entire life than have 1 innocent person be executed. 

The government shouldn't kill people. Not when the entire justice system, from cops to DAs to judges to juries, aren't exactly the best people we got to determine such punishments."
"I don't feel bad for him and I'm not sorry he's dead. 

That said, I don't think the state has the right to kill people. Even people who do shit like that. NOT because I care about this douche bag dying or not dying, because I don't. But rather because the inherent flaws within the justice system and the human beings put in charge of running it means I don't think they ought to kill people, because they cannot guarantee and, in fact, have been shown to kill people who honestly didn't do the crime. Killing people who did do it and are probably better off leaving the oxygen to the rest of us doesn't erase the fact that a lot of people are convicted in a system that is unfair and doesn't get to the truth a good chunk of the time. As long as a mechanism exists by which the state gets to kill people, it's pretty much guaranteed it'll kill the wrong people now and again, and that's unacceptable to me. So I find it hard to celebrate even a situation like this."
"Why would anyone be giving him sympathy after even just reading the headline, details aside? 

I‚Äôm no big proponent of the death penalty, but in cases like this, I get it."
"Finding the death penalty abhorrent has literally nothing to do with sympathy. He could have, and should have, rotted in prison until he died of old age."
Being against the death penalty is not ‚Äògiving him sympathy‚Äô.
"Welp, back to bed for me. Gonna try to start this day over again."
Is there anyone giving him sympathy?
Repeat after me: IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT AN INNOCENT PERSON DIES FROM THE DEATH PENALTY IT SHOULD NOT BE A THING.
"Holy fuck...this world is fucked, man."
"For the sake if transparency you might as well also share that Underwood suffered a ""long history of abuse and serious mental health issues that included autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar and panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and various deviant sexual paraphilias."" 

Killing Underwood won't save the next victim from the next mentally ill person who never got the treatment and attention they desperately needed that might prevent tragedies like this in the first place."
In what world would anyone give this man sympathy?  The title alone is pretty cut and dry...
Can be against the death penalty without having any sympathy. And that aside the man was clearly a psychopath who maybe wouldn't have done this if he had gotten help. Too late for that by any measure though.
Do they go into why he abandoned his plans?
Who the hell read the title and had any synpathy?
So necrophilia too?
"Sympathy? Fuck him, hope he suffered"
The world is such a better place without him in it. Yay
"I had no sympathy to begin with for this guy

I still struggle to understand why we can‚Äôt just test new drugs or war equipment on people like him"
"I don't think there's any room possible for sympathy when reading the title or after reading more, to be honest."
"‚ÄúThe decision to execute me on my birthday and six days before Christmas was a needlessly cruel thing to do to my family,‚Äù"
It was probably a psychological thing and they probably were Fucking with him psychologically.

"Appeals process and the affiliated lawyers, court hearings, etc.. That is why death row is more expensive for tax payers than life sentences."
"The issue is always going to be where we draw that line of ‚Äúno question of their guilt.‚Äù An easy thing to say when discussing someone who is seemingly so far beyond that line ‚Äî but there will still be people who fall on the line. Those whose guilt isn‚Äôt certain, and for which an absolute punishment such as the death penalty is morally wrong."
"What a strange take, ‚Äúim not for the death penalty‚Ä¶. Unless‚Äù is exactly the same as saying you are for it. The death penalty really is a black or white, binary issue, if you are for it in some cases, then you must also be for it in others, and for the risk of innocents suffering it, they go hand in hand"
">I'm not usually in favor of the death penalty, but


So you are in favor of the death penalty."
That just means you're in favor of the death penalty
Every person ever convicted of a crime was done so ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù this delineation you‚Äôre referring to doesn‚Äôt exist and never has.
"I remember when this story first broke and I read some police reports about his interrogation/confession, and what they found in his apartment. That was... well I guess about 18 years ago, and like you, I still remember that shit from time to time. Haunting."
"For me the question isn‚Äôt so much ‚Äúdo some people deserve to die?‚Äù, because the answer is yes, obviously.  The question is ‚Äúdo you trust the state with the power to execute people?‚Äù"
"I‚Äôm sorry, but you are being clouded by emotion.

Having, even the *option*, for death at the behest of the state introduces false positives. It is barbaric to those individuals. That fact, that a certain percentage of innocent individuals will die, should eliminate the option completely.

He should rot in prison, yes, but the inevitable death for an innocent man is immoral."
You know what else is a for sure way to remove him from society? Life in prison. And that option doesn‚Äôt involve state-sponsored killing.
"This is just an emotional reaction and not a reasoning at all.


With a life sentence he would be still away from society.
Also, punishment is and should be a way to re-educate people, not just to takes revenge or something. The fact that sometimes the chance of redeeming someone are very thin (like probably in this case, I don't know the details but fuck him) doesn't invalidate that."
I understand where you're coming from but I still don't think the state should be able to determine who lives and dies.
"There are still two arguments against that. 

First and simplest: the people carrying out the execution aren‚Äôt doctors, and the chemicals they‚Äôre injecting are much more of a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try this and see what happens‚Äù grab-bag that news coverage would have you think. They can and often do go quite wrong, and when they do, it‚Äôs bad:

https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/okla-man-says-he-can-feel-body-burning-during-execution/

Second, and more compellingly in my view: in order to execute him, someone has to do the killing. 

Normal, healthy, well-adjusted human beings don‚Äôt kill other human beings without enormous and permanent psychological consequences. It causes lasting trauma, that takes years of counseling and therapy to get past. And if it doesn‚Äôt, then the state is employing homicidal sociopaths, which is even worse. 

So even if you‚Äôre ok with a guy who killed a kid suffering as he dies - and you shouldn‚Äôt be, because the government that has the power to make him suffer is a government that has the power to make YOU suffer - you shouldn‚Äôt be ok with someone having to have that suffering on their conscience for long years after he‚Äôs dead. And certainly not as a workplace trauma. 

We shouldn‚Äôt kill him because there‚Äôs no way to do it without making someone else a killer. Break the cycle, and let him rot."
"They caught him doing it, he confessed and he showed no remorse either - he openly admitted it"
"I think a better use of taxpayer‚Äôs money would be to use such people as study and test subjects. There‚Äôs absolutely no way we have learned everything we could, and the more we put effort into understanding such evil people and their actions the more likely we will be able to detect and prevent things like the horrible death of this little girl from happening in the future."
It's also a waste of taxpayer money and resources. Why stop killing with killing? It's seems so hypocritical.
And rapists
I hope St. Peter is still beating him with a leaf rake...
"Because the system knows it can be wrong, and that people can be wrongfully convicted. That money is wasted to make as sure as possible that the state and jury didn't make a mistake."
"Because America is a civilised country, which doesn‚Äôt just shoot people for commuting a crime"
Does this apply to CEOs also?
"In cases like this, nobody gives a flying fuck including myself. Go pat yourself on the back for some moral superiority or whatever, but this was true justice considering the law and the justice system are fucking bullshit anyways. If you are rich enough you can do whatever you want."
oh ok üëç
Well said. Now brace for pitchforks.
"Do you think ""but this person was REALLY bad"" is a good argument against the statistical evidence that innocent people have been executed?"
"That WILL get innocent people killed, even more so than now. There's a reason this system isn't in use anymore."
Do you believe the legal system to be without flaw?
"so you aren't against the death penalty then?

"Until you or someone you love is innocent and wrongly convicted and put to death. Then you‚Äôll be the strongest anti death penalty advocate in the world or you‚Äôll be dead.

Downvote me all you want the death penalty has resulted in so many innocents dying. The state should have no say in whether or not we die because even if 1 in 1,000,000,000 innocents are out to death it‚Äôs not worth the possibility of getting it wrong. And guess what folks the probability they get it wrong is way lower than that. Just remember it could always be you.

The death penalty isn‚Äôt justice it‚Äôs fascism."
"Honestly I‚Äôm not and for only one reason, his family did nothing wrong and they are the ones that have to live with this. He‚Äôd be just as dead executed in mid January and his family‚Äôs emotional trauma will do nothing to lessen the trauma for his victims family. I‚Äôm not opposed to it on his account, but he has a mom and she didn‚Äôt hurt anyone."
"""According to the most recent DOJ report, the average time between sentencing and execution is 15.5 years.""

That's an insanely slow system. Here's a [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Fact_check/Is_the_death_penalty_more_expensive_than_life_in_prison) about the extra costs of the death penalty."
"No they couldn‚Äôt, you have a right to appeal"
Unfortunately it's more expensive to taxpayers to kill him than keep him alive. There is no upside other than thirst for revenge through extreme violence- take that as you will.
"I‚Äôm not bothered by him being in jail. He‚Äôs off the streets, it‚Äôs potentially cheaper to keep him locked up than killing him. My justice boner isnt strong enough to care if he‚Äôs executed."
"It‚Äôs stupid to support the death penalty, the government can‚Äôt be trusted to decide who lives and who dies."
Plenty of people have confessed to crimes they didn‚Äôt do. The death penalty costs more than life imprisonment. Both arguments dogshit.
"Killing people, regardless of what they did, is just wrong. I'm against the death penalty, period."
It‚Äôs literally more expensive to kill him. You‚Äôre just engaging in bloodlust.
Yeah I went to a wine tasting with him but he would only try the chiantis.
The only sad part of his execution is that it took 18 years to happen.
Neither will I. But I will continue to lose sleep over the fact that we allow the state to kill its own citizens
"only person I feel bad for is his mom, it was partially her fault for not paying attention to his mental health prior to him committing his cannibalistic act, but at the same time, mental health struggles weren‚Äôt taken seriously during this time. 
his mom had to testify for clemency a week before his execution, that whole week must have been horrible, him being denied clemency, then got executed the day of his birthday, i hope she goes to therapy jeez"
"Bruh, that apology is appropriate for fighting with your sibling, or at a max theft. Tf you cant just say that for something this severe."
Rest in Piss.
"Super weird way for his family to react, if he's not just making it up. If a member of my family did something like that and was slated to be executed, I'd hope they'd carry out the killing ASAP. 

Murdering and sexually assaulting a child, in whichever order, would be considered a pretty major stain on the reputation of most families."
Maybe he should have thought about his family when he did what he did.
"To be fair, I don‚Äôt think there is ANYTHING you could possibly say to improve that situation.

That said‚Ä¶ Fuck that guy.  I hope they cremated him snd used his ashes as part of a turnpike."
">""but I'm very sorry for what I did and I wish I could take it back.""

Why is he talking like a tween vaguebooking during the early 2010s? He killed and almost ate a little girl!"
"Too late for sorry, buddy."
"Should have told him it was absolutely on purpose because he deserves it. Happy Deathday to you, asshole."
"I agree -- fuck this guy, he's obviously irredeemable.¬†

That said, the birthday execution does kinda just feel like adding insult to injury for an innocent family that's probably already distraught."
I need that Smiling and Nodding Jack Nicholson gif
"No, that defiantly should count as cruel and unusual imo, there‚Äôs no reason to do it on his birthday, there‚Äôs 364 other days and that must have been a conscious decision to ensure more suffering for him and his family"
The more I find out about this guy the less I like him.¬†
"I feel like this should be so obvious to people‚Ä¶ so many people distrust the government and justice system but then turn around and cheer this on. That‚Äôs not to mention that I could see this being an eighth amendment violation of cruel and unusual punishment but that really depends on if the guy even cares if it is his birthday himself. Everyone still has constitutional rights, even Hitler would have had them had he been brought to the US somehow. It‚Äôs one of the main things that I feel patriotic about and so many seem to want to throw these rights in the garbage for nothing‚Ä¶"
"This. Innocent people have ""admitted"" to crimes before because criminal investigations are deliberately underhanded. Preciously few people are worried about death penalty for irredeemably evil, sadistic people. But no one is clairvoyant or omniscient. And even 1 single innocent person being put to death is enough reason for me to support no death penalty for any crime."
(most) People who argue against the death penalty don't think that this person deserves to live. They'd just rather give this guy life in prison than risk an innocent person die from the same law.
"According to his lawyers, he had a whole list of mental issues that should have at least spared him from death row, if not having him placed in a mental institution.

Edit: Since this is apparently necessary, I am not defending his actions. I am answering the question of why someone might oppose his execution."
"Dude did a monstrous thing, I think it‚Äôs okay to fuck with him. I doubt being executed on his birthday weighed heavily on his mind for long."
18 years.
"Is the primary issue the ethics of having the authority to decide whether another person lives or dies, or of someone being falsely charged, or both?"
"The objections to the death penalty come from many different sources, so it's possible to approve some of them while objecting to others. For example I'm anti-death penalty, but think there are many people who's death can be justified. My negative sentiment towards the practice comes from my lack of trust towards the judicial system and governments, and the fact that for a society there are good alternatives to the death penalty. People are biased, corrupt and abuse power, so the system deciding things will at times reflect that. Societies also have the resources and capability to forcefully isolate individuals from the public for the entirety of their lives. That way society is protected and there is zero risk of wrongful conviction or abuse of power."
I‚Äôm in favor of the death penalty except when they might be innocent
"This exactly. I won't miss this guy, and also, I don't want a government to have the power to kill anybody, including this guy."
"Bingo.  They get it wrong a lot.  I'm not ok with the death penalty,  ut I can still be ok with this guy being dead.  I'm not ok with murder either... but I'm fine with one less CEO too."
"Reminds me of the time our government hired some guy to execute nazis after ww2, John Clarence Woods. Who made all kinds of claims about being an executioner and was just some weird dead eyed pyscho freak who was lying. 

I would never shed a tear for some nazi officer getting fucking slain but it's still kinda a weird thing to have happened."
"Agreed. 

And how arrogant to think that anyone has the right to ever decide who lives or dies. Makes his judge no better than him.

I hate the ‚Äúeye for an eye‚Äù response. It‚Äôs an emotional retribution rather than an actual punishment. Also an easy way out for the accused.

Let him be forgotten in jail."
"Well said! 

Nobody‚Äôs saying this person should have the chance at parole or a work release program‚Ä¶ but reading these comments it‚Äôs kind of shocking seeing how the average American is just frothing at the mouth to see reciprocal punishments dished out by the state.

I don‚Äôt understand why either ü§î 

Maybe it‚Äôs a way for them to pretend that our system is fair, and they trick themselves into believing people really get what they deserve?

Idk but I‚Äôm with you on this one. IMO Rehabilitation should be the goal but this case and any similar others should be the exception to the rule. he should be under the guardianship of the state until he expires naturally."
"But would it be ok in a hypothetical reality where the possibility of false positives could be completely eliminated? It‚Äôs easy to see how someone could be against the death penalty if they were against executing guilty people. That is logically clear.

But I think it‚Äôs interesting to base an objection only on the false positive cases and be otherwise ok with the idea of putting a heinous murderer to death. Is one innocent death too many to ever risk executing anyone under any circumstance, or would it be ok to continue executions if the false positives were kept below a minimum threshold?"
I dont think someone who did something this heinous should be allowed to live out his life. And taxpayers shouldnt have to pay for his care and feeding.
The problem is always that there are innocent people who end up getting the death penalty. This guy there's no real question. But if you read the article eleven people have been found innocent after ending up on death row.
"I agree, fuck this guy but it is scary that such an incompetent state such as Oklahoma has that power."
"You aren't mentioning a jury, which has a role in convicting someone."
The state is the people brother. Jury of your peers
Well he decided that his victim should die so fuck him.
"That‚Äôs all well and good except for the fact this jailbird had admitted to everything. If someone admits to abducting, assaulting, strangling, sexually assaulting and then partially beheading a 10 year old girl and at no point do they feign innocence, death sounds like the appropriate course of action.¬†"
I hope they don't need to
"I am intensely anti-death penalty but there are people who get me to occasionally say to my partner ‚ÄúI hope they get 20 years in the electric chair‚Äù. Don‚Äôt recall where I first heard that phrase, but it always stuck with me as an appropriate response to people like the guy in the article."
"Petition for a new state motto: ""OK is okay."""
"While I do agree in principle that the death penalty is wrong since innocent people are wrongly executed, this was not that. He confessed to everything, multiple times, the first being after the police found the remains in his apartment, He said he deserves to die for what he did. If you're going to get on a moral high horse, argue what his lawyers did that he was fucked up in the head and should be in a mental institution, not death row."
"Wow, people change their minds about issues that affect them personally? 

Who would have thought?"
"And until your 10 year old daughter is lured into an adult man's apartment ...I'm not going to restate what he *admitted to doing*, but when that's your daughter, you may find yourself significantly more comfortable with the death penalty."
I agree with you. The fact is that people abuse everything. Get the wrong person in charge and innocent people start dying. Something that started with good intentions can quickly turn the into the opposite. Then come the people hOw diD wE gEt HeRE? America is about to be at that point probably. Rounding up people (in this case illegal immigrants) has never ever had good intentions. Hopefully they don‚Äôt turn into death camps. It‚Äôs expensive to house and feed people for an undetermined amount of time. And we seen how this country and political leaders feel about ‚Äúfree‚Äù food and housing.
"This man wasn‚Äôt innocent. I‚Äôm not a fan of the death penalty for debated cases, however when there is **NO DOUBT** then it is the best option!"
"""Underwood admitted to luring Jamie into his apartment and beating her over the head with a cutting board before suffocating and sexually assaulting her. He told investigators that he nearly beheaded the girl in his bathtub before abandoning his plans to eat her.""


I'm sure if you were this little girl's dad you woulda forgave him."
you are correct regardless of the downvotes
"Ok but this dude admitted it. 

The girl was ten. Ten."
"Fascism is a very specific form of a nationalist populist movement.  People have been put to death under almost every form of government espousing in almost every political ideology.  

'Tyranny' or 'despotism' would be more accurate words to convey your message."
I'm also just straight up opposed to the death penalty. I'm not ok with this
As you should.
[deleted]
I feel like spending nearly 2 decades in prison before getting executed would suck more than just getting executed.
"Exactly , they should have executed him right away."
"Yeah, even cases like this do not justify the death penalty, no matter how evil the guy is. Life without parole would have achieved the same thing"
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶the only person you feel bad for???
Honestly there probably isn't anything you can ever say. This is one of the worst things you could possibly do. Might as well say you're sorry.
"You can always apologise, doesn't mean anybody has to accept the apology."
"We just put down our cat yesterday because his cancer had progressed too far. That quote is closer to the sentiment people are giving us, with the universe being the needlessly cruel thing. If I were his family that would be a welcome early Christmas present!"
Rot in piss*
"Familial love is a pretty powerful thing to overcome, even in the most horrifying scenarios."
"actually it wasnt weird at all, easier to say than done‚Ä¶ that was his mom, whatever he did, he was still her son. and i doubt that family reputation was at the top of the list"
I think most people don‚Äôt judge an entire family based on one member. I wouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúMajor Stain‚Äù what it is this 1952. If the mother chooses to support her son then she has unconditional love for him.
"Oh no‚Ä¶ anyway. Really, what does it matter if it‚Äôs on his birthday vs any other day? Did he care what day he killed that girl on? Did he care what her family members would think? Yeah fuck that guy. I have no sympathy for him or his family members tbh.

Edit: A ton of people are defending the perp and his family and saying he should have the choice to be executed on another day LOL. Do y‚Äôall understand how MURDERING someone works? You don‚Äôt exactly get to pick and choose how you die lmao. Also his family had him for EIGHTEEN MORE YEARS. that girl would be 28 years old today. Do you think she got to choose the date she was murdered on? So I feel worse for the victims family and do not feel the need to sympathize with the perp‚Äôs family. Afaik, their feelings are irrelevant in this case as he‚Äôs already been convicted and given the death penalty, and they were able to be there at his death. I don‚Äôt really know why we need to take their feelings into account in a legal case. That little girl died alone with no family around her."
If anyone in my family did that shit I'd bring a birthday cake to eat at his execution. FUCK HIM
They raised a pedophile rapist cannibal
"Many of my criminal justice professors, one of who was a state prison warden, used to say ‚Äú we done have a Justice system we have a Vengeance system.‚Äù In particular when it came to capital punishment.¬†

The internet and Reddit especially seem to love vengeance.¬†"
"No the damage is done, he murdered and cannibalized a 10 yo ffs. He deserves no humanity as he offered none to the victim."
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm anti-death penalty, but think there are many people whose death can be justified.‚Äù 

You are not anti-death penalty. You are pro-death penalty but you want it to be very specifically meted out based on criteria you deem valid. That is no different than someone who advocates for greater use of capital punishment, you just have varying degrees of what you believe should qualify it as a punishment. Ultimately you both support the application of death as punishment for crime, which is not an anti-capital punishment position."
"Absolutely, the death penalty is not black and white. For me, I object to the death penalty, unless we have a way to perfectly convict the correct guy everytime and get the severity of charges right based on the circumstances everytime and be sure that the law we are following is absolutely correct and not written by morons any other factor that might come in to play. 

The risk of executing an innocent should be unacceptable, not that imprisoning an innocent for any time is any better. Based on that, an argument could be made for the death penalty that it's hypocritical for someone to be ok with ruining an innocent's life by imprisonment rather than execution. 

Personally, I feel like punishment that fits the crime is fair, as long as everything in the system is perfect. But it's not and we have absolutely no idea if the punishment will ever fit any crime. So we should never punish anyone but rehabilitate them. Until one day where we have a perfect system then punish away. Man I'm all over the place."
">but reading these comments it‚Äôs kind of shocking seeing how the average American is just frothing at the mouth to see reciprocal punishments dished out by the state.

You get the same reaction for much less heinous crimes, too. Some people really have a bloodlust for criminals."
It's more burdening to tax payers to give him the death penalty than life in prison.
"The death penalty is more expensive than life in prison.

Also, the argument isn't that someone who did something this heinous should be allowed to live. The argument is that we can't trust the government to get the right person."
The chances of me deeply trusting the judgement of 12 random individuals seems highly unlikely. Would you not say the same for yourself?
Have you ever done jury duty? It's very easy to lose faith in the common sense and analytical skills of your peers.
Yeah. And people are idiots.
"The state is the prosecutors, brother, the ones who decide whether or not they're going to try for the desth penalty."
"False confessions are surprisingly common. He could have been coerced or deceived into confessing, or he could have been protecting the real killer by taking the blame. The system can never be certain its executing the right person."
So we should have just thrown out the law and safeguards because he confessed? How bad does the crime have to be before we decide that due process is unnecessary?
"Yeah, canibal zombies aren't what we need right now, although it might improve the Trump presidency period."
"I remember that from the movie Sneakers, which was a good movie in its own right. Something like ""We got nothing, if we turn ourselves in now, we'll get 20 years in the electric chair!"""
"Are you really intensely anti-death penalty if you think some people should have it. You have the exact same stance that the death penalty should be reserved for serious crimes as everyone else but get to pretend that you have the moral highground. Someone actually intensely anti-death penalty would have a comment like ""I won't mourn his death but I still don't think the state should have the right to execute people""."
At that point you‚Äôre just overcooking the meat.
Thank you. Im stealing this.
'Oklahoma is OK' was the state slogan for decades lol
I‚Äôm not on a high horse the death penalty is fucking scary. There‚Äôs a reason only right wing states still do it. Putting that power in the governments hands is insane.
"Yeah the last one. The FBI improved their chances of finding serial killers by interviewing and studying captured serial killers.

This is why the death penalty is always wrong. Sure, this guy deserved it. But he could have been useful in other ways."
"I haven't looked into this particular case so I'm sure they have more physical evidence than just a confession, but I've actually done a lot of research into false confessions and they are *much, much* more common than the public wants to think. LE is allowed to use extremely fucked up tactics to push suspects into a confession, and mentally ill, emotional, or developmentally challenged/low IQ suspects are particularly susceptible to it. I know many people like to think a confession is a guarantee that they have the right guy, but it definitely isn't, especially the longer it's been from the crime.

Most of these confessors genuinely believe they did, even if they didn't. Memories are not concrete, they're mallible and easy to manipulate. There was this interesting course I read about where the professor would go to great lengths to convince the students that an event had happened in their past by enlisting their friends and family to insist it happened, and even though most of them didn't remember it at first, by the end of the module every student had been convinced their event did occur, and the events varied in seriousness, with some of them being crimes and incidents that you'd really think you'd remember. Once all the students accepted they'd done the event readily, the prof revealed the module and that none of it ever happened. Some of the students interviewed said that even years later, knowing it was a class and it never happened, they still have the false memory of doing it."
"Yeah, because nobody has ever confessed to something that is untrue under duress or other circumstances."
"Yes, if only because it‚Äôs impossible to make clear delineation between the ‚Äúabsolutely guilty‚Äù and ‚Äúprobably guilty.‚Äù Regardless of where we draw that line, there will be people who fall on it. There will be innocent people who are put to death."
"Man, some of you Redditors really lack in the critical thinking department, don't you?"
"People admit to crimes they haven‚Äôt done all the time because of poor interrogation tactics and plea deals. Not saying that is what happened here, but is an example of how it‚Äôs difficult to create a line."
It‚Äôs about the bigger picture. You can justify anything with a specific enough story.
It shouldn‚Äôt take an innocent loved one being put to death for anyone to realize the death penalty is bad fucking idea. It‚Äôs very simple critical thinking.
"You‚Äôre discussing revenge, not justice. There‚Äôs a reason why we don‚Äôt allow people who know the victim to sit on juries and the like."
"I‚Äôm opposed to the death penalty as well, though in this case its more just as a general principle. 

This is not one of the cases I‚Äôd be using in an argument against it for example‚Ä¶

An example of a case I would use: https://thegrio.com/2020/06/16/george-stinney-execution-south-carolina/

In cases like this where he claims the date would be hurtful to his own family, I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to them doing something like supplying him with a lethal dose of barbiturates or something else he could choose to take voluntarily before hand if he so chose‚Ä¶. But thats assuming the death penalty is guaranteed otherwise (i.e. still against the death penalty, but at least it could be on a different date if he so chose).

Edit; Just to state it again‚Ä¶ The hypothetical barbiturate scenario is intended only in a case where the death penalty was already confirmed, where the inmate would have the option himself to move up the date of execution on his own accord if he so wanted, with his own actions‚Ä¶  It is not an an argument supporting the death penalty."
"So we should do away with appeals for irreversible punishment?

Or maybe we shouldn‚Äôt fuck around in the business of killing people at all."
I feel like if they put him in the general population and simply let the other inmates know why he was in prison he would not have spent nearly 2 decades there.
"Nah, the nearly 2 decades of prison. Then finally told you‚Äôre dying on your bday is worth. Evil piece of shit."
you know what i mean
Not just one. All of the worst things you could do. Straight up demon.
"No. This is just beyond evil. I could not love anyone that did this to an innocent little girl, no matter who they were.¬†"
"Bullshit.

My step-brother did some things pre-9/11 that would have seen him locked up instead of out on probation. Nobody was harmed or injured, but our entire family cut him off and we hadn't spared a thought about him until we learned that he died from a drug overdose a few years ago.

You're an amoral person if you can stand behind someone simply because of blood ties."
"His victim did not have her mother there to comfort her as she died at the hands of a monster. His mother and family were there to comfort him in his death. They should be more ashamed and left him to die alone. A mother can love unconditionally and still show there are consequences to his actions, like an execution, alone, on his birthday (big fuckin deal)."
I'm sure
"To be fair, I agree with and support his execution. But at the end of the day I feel like almost nobody can be blamed for raising a pedophile rapist cannibal. Some people are sick beyond repair with no cause for having such depraved natures. A lot can go wrong during human development independent of the best resources, family, and environment...."
"Such an out of touch comment; some people are just fucking nuts.

Nurture is *not* everything."
"Unless they abused him, themselves, which there's no record of, there's nothing a parent could ever do to ensure their kid won't turn out to be that deranged. That's faulty mental wiring."
"I mean the guy was obviously crazy lol. Without knowing anything about his upbringing, it's pretty hard to blame his family."
"People love these stories cause then they're like ""Death penalty? If I was in charge we'd [blank] his [blank] and stick his [blank] in his [blank] until [blank] [blank] [blank...]"" And it's like ok dude do you hate this guy or do you just love torture?"
It‚Äôs honestly terrifying to realize how few among us feel like this. One really good deepfake video would be enough for like 90% of people to execute someone‚Ä¶
"""...before abandoning his plans to eat her.""

Just to get the facts straight, he didn't actually eat her it says. It may have been what instigated this for him, but I'm ok calling him a deceased pedophile rapist."
"I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with anything anyone has said. 

I've been on a jury 

One person wanted to vote guilty strictly due to the defendant's race.

He changed his mind because he was hungry and wanted to be let out so the case could be finished and he could get some dinner.

Was the defendant guilty? Everybody ""thought"" so... Myself included.

BUT!

Did the state bring forth enough evidence to prove guilt? No.

We voted not guilty. Only because a person with bigotry in his heart voted with his stomach... Which was in direct contradiction to the instructions the judge gave.

The experience was eye opening."
"The people who claim to be the most moral in these situations often forget, guilty or not, your decision directly leads to someone being killed. 

I don‚Äôt think I can ever say with certainty that someone deserves to die."
"See my other reply üëç

Sometimes I forget that commenting needs to be dumbed down due to it being more difficult to read between the lines ü´§"
"I didn‚Äôt detail that due process should also take place, as that is pretty fucking obvious I would have thought!

Due process was followed, he admitted to it, he was found guilty and maintained that he was guilty the entire time. There is no question that he was guilty of the horror that happened to that innocent young girl.

Feel free to go read some case notes, court docs, etc"
Bit like a more twisted version of that 'Black Mirror' episode?
"The reality is that the state makes mistakes. If there were a way to be 100% certain of guilt I'd be ok with the death penalty for rapists / murderers / child molesters. But the thought of the government executing an innocent person is way worse, so that's the only reason I'm anti death penalty."
"‚ÄúThe state should never execute anyone, period. Crime/body count is irrelevant.‚Äù

This is the position I hold."
"Yet ""Missouri loves company"" has never been theirs. Some states need to get it together."
LOL I had no idea! Though honestly I'm not all that surprised.
"When there is absolute evidence, they testify without coercion and DNA and any evidence on the scene proves they did it and if the case is probably a double or triple homicide and such gruesome acts then it is fair enough. That sick bastard doesn‚Äôt deserve anyhing else"
"I disagree. There are absolutely cases where the death penalty is warranted. Perhaps strticter than it currently is where still employed, but some people should not exist and aren't worth draining taxes to keep in a cage. In my mind this is in a perfect justice system. The problem however where I agree with you is that the justice system is imperfect and does wrongly prosecute some percentage of those convicted. I'm not going to say it's some huge percentage or part of the total, but innacuracy should be accounted.   

Rehabilitation > internment > death"
"I will never understand people who are strictly against the death penalty. Why do you value the lives of people who clearly do not value the lives of their victims?

I can get that people would want the conditions to be different, so there is less risk of executing innocent people.

But there are cases like school shooters, terrorists, and in general people who are literally caught in the act, where there is absolutely no doubt about their guilt. Those are the people who should be given immediate death penalty with no chance to appeal."
You call it revenge- I call it punishment
"Not revenge, accountability."
"And when the abuser gets murdered by the father and the father gets an insanely light sentence, is that not justice?"
"Here is the deal. My problem with the death penalty is twofold: that innocent people get nuked, and that it is painful.

And what separates us from psychopaths if we get joy from their horrific death?"
That or solitary confinement with no visitors and no sunlight
"One of my mom's neighbors growing up was murdered by way of an ax to the head by another neighbor in front of his whole family at the dinner table in a similar instance of psychosis back when she was a kid. The daughter of the man who was killed spent some years being angry and hateful, but what is most impressive to me is that she ended up starting an organization to encourage and facilitate more understanding and forgiveness in these situations, specifically because she understands how important it is for the remaining family for healing and moving on. 

https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/stories-library/anne-marie-hagan/

I think her understanding and testimony of this type of tragedy holds significant weight, considering her experience having also received some ax blows herself in the incident trying to save her father. I think it's important to acknowledge that there are multiple forgiveness themed organizations started by different families of murder victims in many communities. That's not an insignificant point."
"Alternatively, if someone does something horrible during a true mental health crisis and shows genuine remorse while accepting the correct punishment for what they've done it is easy to love the person they are and not the action they did when they snapped.  Life isn't black and white.  It is messy.  It is even messier when you include love."
"I love this POV too, the other family couldn‚Äôt even argue for their little girl back, and this family is arguing clemency for the brutal murder of a 10 year old girl. Even if he had mental illness, that doesn‚Äôt give people a free pass to murder and sexually assault children, so the amount of people defending this perp is absurd. Literally none of them even bring up how the other family must have felt, waiting for this case to close after EIGHTEEN YEARS lol and the only thing these redditors can fixate on is the fact that his mom is sad he‚Äôs going to die on his birthday??!?!?? That little girl didn‚Äôt have her mom by her side when she died! Tell me you have no emotional or social awareness without telling me."
"I used to work in residential treatment for boys with behavioral problems. They got in fights, stole, raped their younger siblings and relatives. Almost every single one of them had been abused. Seriously, I only remember 1 kid out of the 4 years I did that job that the parents seemed normal and the kid didn't report abuse. Nurture isn't everything but it's fucking most of it."
Still an offense that should earn him the chair no?
I think i can live with this one dying.
Due process still puts innocent people on death row with alarming frequency.
"People give false confessions. There is no evidence it happened in this case, but it does happen. That is why. The delay is part of the due process. The fact he did something unforgivable doesn't change what the law is, or why it is the way it is."

Not sure what 'Black Morror' is.....but this dude killed a helpless 10yo girl. Death is too good for him.
"I agree with you in principle, but we KNOW that those definitions would get stretched. We KNOW that cops and prosecutors would lie or bury the truth. We KNOW that innocent people would be out to death. How do we know? Because the current system has guardrails that have been violated. We have seen innocent people get executed. 

I largely agree with you. I'm theoretically okay with the death penalty in certain circumstances. If someone is caught in the act, for example. However, one innocent person is too many and I just don't trust our justice system to get it right 100% of the time."
"Do you honestly hold the opinion that another person's horrible actions absolve the rest of us of the responsibility to abstain from immoral behavior? He's a cannibal so fuck it, why not torture the guy before we kill him and invite any one curious about cannibalism but with enough restraint to not commit a crime to come have a taste?"
How would he ever do anything like this while being locked up? Please explain your critical thought process or intelligent reasoning.
"At least you're able to admit that, so now's your chance to improve yourself. Perhaps you can begin with realizing that the death penalty is not about any one particular case. You're wanting to draw an arbitrary line for who lives and who dies. Should someone that kills someone during a robbery be put to death? What about a drunk driver that kills a family in a car crash? You might not think so, but what if someone else does? Where is the line for who lives and who dies? 

Over two hundred innocent people have been on death row in the United States before they were exonerated and an estimated 4% of people on death row are innocent. Are you okay with killing innocent people just because you want to be able to execute someone that committed what you feel is a particularly heinous crime?

You claim that because they admitted to the crime that means it's justifiable to kill them. Did you know that over 25% of those exonerated by the Innocence Project were coerced into giving a false confession? By your irredeemable logic, we should just execute those people because they admitted to committing the crime. Is that what happened in this case? Unlikely, but you can't apply your poor standards to one case but not others.

You and I don't get to decide who lives and who dies."
The average death row inmate costs more to the tax payer than a life imprisonment. There‚Äôs a reason only right wing states are the ones to still do it. The government killing people is fascist and is an insane power that they should not hold because it is imperfect.
"No, there isn‚Äôt. Americas use of the death penalty is as barbaric as the cannibal you just killed. The rest of the west abolished it, but the blood craving shame filled puritan culture that still runs the US stops progress here."
"Sitting around for the rest of your time in a prison is punishment, death is an escape."
Something like 5% of prisoners should be exonerated. Thats 1 in 20 people are potentially innocent - way too high.
"I agree with those points,  but would add three other points as well:

1.  It doesn‚Äôt reduce crime.

2.  It‚Äôs more expensive than life imprisonment.

3.  It undermines an claims to acting as an example for human rights internationally.

In short, I fail to see what net benefits the death penalty actually does have‚Ä¶."
"Also, what preventative measures does it serve when the people executed are so ill, deprived, and depraved? I would argue the death penalty would be better served in serious cases of white collar ‚Äúsocial murder‚Äù and serious political crimes, if it should be used at all. Which, with the state of the judiciary, I would seriously doubt."
"We don't execute him as a vengeance, we simply get rid of a cancerous cell of the body of society,"
Yeah but there's delinquents and then there's literal nutcase cannibals like this.
"If you support the death penalty, then I'd agree."
Executioner is a title choice.
"Black Mirror is anthology series on Netflix of different and horrific scenarios with different advanced technology. 

In the episode being referred to, a couple killed a little girl - well, the man killed her, and she just filmed.

So her punishment ends up her being terrorized, while dozens of people around her just video it, and then her memory gets wiped and it happens all over again."
Why laws gotta be based on feelings and emotion. Why can't we leave that archaic practice to religion. Make laws practical through reason and logic. Efficient even if it is crass.
"It costs more because they wait so long. Because the system is so prone to mistakes.  

The government killing people for their beliefs or opposition is fascist. A justice system executing truly heinous criminals that have no chance of rehabilitation is not the same thing.  

Like the American private prison complex is already one of the most disgusting parts of the country, the death penalty is not the most pressing issue."
"Someone replied to my comment arguing about the fact the death penalty is more expensive than the alternative‚Ä¶ of course they offered zero evidence supporting that claim, and deleted their comment right after I gathered several sources indicating that their claim was bullshit.


So just posting what was intended to be a reply to their comment here instead‚Ä¶

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

And you base your argument on what exactly?  Do you have even a SINGLE source that lists a study that supports that argument?

[Studies consistently find that the death penalty is more expensive than alternative punishments.](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/costs)

[Each death penalty inmate is approximately $1.12 million (2015 USD) more than a general population inmate.](https://www.cato.org/blog/financial-implications-death-penalty#:~:text=Each%20death%20penalty%20inmate%20is,reallocate%20them%20from%20other%20sources.)

[The most rigorous cost study in the country found that a single death sentence in Maryland costs almost $2 million more than a comparable non-death penalty case.](https://ejusa.org/resource/wasteful-inefficient/)

[Nationally, the death penalty costs taxpayers an average of $1 million than a life without
parole sentence, making it the most expensive part of our criminal justice system on a per
offender basis.](https://www.uakron.edu/ccj/events/docs/OTSE_Cost.pdf)"
"While I don't generally support the death penalty mostly for the other two reasons you list and because of the countless times innocent men were murdered by the state for crimes they didn't commit, there is nothing inherently expensive about a death penalty. It doesn't have to cost more than a few bullets and some overtime for whoever pulls the trigger.

Of course (part of) the irony is that most of that cost is administrative which you'd think would ensure that only genuinely guilty and deserving people are executed but that is absolutely not the case in reality. I don't believe that the average executed prisoner is any more likely to be guilty than the average non-0executed prisoner.

But ultimately is there anything more American at its core than needlessly going above and beyond in expense and effort to ensure that one person dies as miserably as possible instead of helping and healing a hundred times more people? I don't think so."

"The tip about him came from Saudi Arabia. That makes me wonder if he was also being stalked, gaslit, and/or harassed by Saudi agents. I doubt the intent was to induce the car attack, but it probably didn't help his mental stability."
"""Crazy how tips can get ignored until it‚Äôs too late."""
"100%, especially if said tip is coming from Saudi Arabia of all places."
"I don‚Äôt know German laws either, but in the USA it would depend on the evidence they have."
"He made multiple threats, though. I guess Germany doesn't have a ""terroristic threats"" criminal charge like the US does."
"It's kind of funny though if you think about it. EU etc. wants to introduce chat control aka proposes to oblige providers to search all private¬†*chats*, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content (They try to push it for like 5th time already) citing safety of kids, fighting terrorism etc. yet they don't want to do anything when they get ""potentially"" real tip. When something bad like this happens, then they blame anyone but themselves (I'm talking about politicians, police etc.)

On the other hand, when someone calls someone idiot on social media, they are the first to knock on your doors. Seems that they have different priorities."
"So he kills people at a Christmas Market, and not the people he is complaining about. Makes no sense, but I guess when you're crazy you don't necessarily think logically."
">addicts, prostitutes, and thieves, in order to corrupt the movement from within.


Sounds like his people within whatever org he is saying is being corrupted, just likes drugs, sex, and money. You know like almost all humans.¬†"
"Seems the final thing that set him off was a USB stick disappearing, whether he misplaced it or someone actually stole it."
"> The tip about him came from Saudi Arabia.

My question is also. How many of these sort of tips do governments in the west get from Saudi Arabia?

Are they serious enough that they should be looked into, in which case Germany clearly fucked up. Or do they just spam them trying to discredit dissidents abroad, essentially just making it noise that any sane state ignores. 

This is after all the same Saudis that murdered Jamal Khashoggi. Not sure I would trust the information coming out of them regarding anyone critical of Islam or Saudi leadership."
I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties
Saudi's have abused anti-terrorism laws to harass dissidents for years its watered down the warning to the point they are worthless.
He might have deliberately mimicked the ISIS car attacks of 2014-2017 in hopes people would blame it on islamists.
"Oh, I understand now, I also get moody when my USBs disappear on me."
"Yes, yes I am."
This is honestly the first time I've heard of a hurricane/typhoon/cyclone hitting east Africa. Is this something rare or just super underreported?¬†
"In Spanish, that cyclone's name is awesome"
Man Africa is always getting the shaft
All my heart to Mozambique üá≤üáø‚ù§Ô∏è
"FWIW this is the same storm feared to have killed ""hundreds to thousands"" in French Mayotte, though only a couple dozen have been confirmed so far. Not uncommon to have storms in this neck of the woods, but certainly rare for them to be this strong"
Can we arrest this Cyclone for killing people
I thought that was warlords name at first.
This is almost a yearly occurrence.
"They hit multiple times a year. It‚Äôs just underreported. Tropical Cyclones hit every continent on earth with the exception of Antarctica (but South America and Europe get hit with the fewest, usually around 1 every 4 ish decades for South America (E.g. Cyclone Catarina of 2004) and once every few years for Europe (most recent of which being Subtropical Storm Alpha of 2020). Extratropical cyclones are far more common in Europe.

East Africa, Australia, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Southwestern Pacific, the eastern coast of Asia, Western coast of North America (between Nicaragua and around San Diego) and the North Atlantic are all tropical cyclone hotspots.¬†[Wikipedia has a good article about it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_basins)"
Not very awesome in my opinion
Whoever named it has a terribly dark sense of humour.
Pienso que no parace chido tbh
"Maybe it means people just didn‚Äôt pay very close attention to Mozambique‚Äôs cyclones until recently. There have been much worse cyclones there in past years. The one from 2019, Idai, killed thousands of people."
"Ah yes, the two cardinal directions South and East.

Nobody tell this guy what the word Southeast means!"
I think he meant to say the word chido literally means awesome in Spanish per the definition.
What don't you like about the name?
The person you‚Äôre responding to is making a joke lol
"The word ""awesome"" is culturally associated with something positive in the West, so they are likely from there, including myself. It's like the word Great. We can call someone ""Michael the Great"" but if he killed a hundred people, someone might comment ""Uh, Michael the not-so-great"" because they see that word as a compliment that shouldn't be given to someone like that. Same with Awesome.

When, really, the word itself isn't originally intended to be a compliment or necessarily positive in the social sense. But more so positive in the cold, scientific, technical sense such as ""powerful."" Someone can be Powerful or Awe-inspiring but be a terrible person. Same with events. But people internalize these things in a social-cultural sense instead of acknowledging what the word really meant originally."
"I'm guessing it's the disturbing comment about the name being awesome despite the fact that people died. 

Seems a bit insensitive."
"You realize just because its ""awesome"" in one languague, doesnt mean its same in others..."
Oh I didn't even notice!
I think this is an example of a word's meaning subtly shifting based on cultural differences. Fun stuff!
Ooooooo yep that is a colossal fuckup‚Ä¶ lotta folks about to head home
"Shot down by the guided missile cruiser, USS Gettysburg, traveling with the carrier USS Harry Truman, which had probably launched the jets to begin with.  

Would not want to be on the Gettysburg tonight."
"Recovered with minor injuries to one. 
Awesome, they get a sweet watch or something now from the people who make the ejection seats. 

Would not want to be on the Gettysburg right now.."
I‚Äôm glad that everyone seemed to escape the incident alive. What a fuck up
"""Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft,"""
Someone's getting fired
"Accidental friendly fires happen more than they should.  When I was stationed in Alaska (late 80's) one F-15 accidentally fired a live missile against another.  The plane was wrecked, but was able to return to Elmendorf.

The story:  Elmendorf is the main AFB, but there are two forward bases that do most of the intercepts of Russian bombers.  They have to shuttle missiles back and forth for maintaince.  They wanted to run some sidewinders to the forward base so F-15s on a training flight were carrying them.

The missiles were NOT supposed to be armed, but multiple mistakes were made preping the planes and the pilot missed the mistake.  When they were training/dogfighting, one F-15 live fired a missile against the other.  He radiod ahead and the guy tried to evade, but was hit.  The plane did make it back.

The pilot who was hit was, as I recall, the wing commander.  They fired the squardron command and the wing commander because the buck for the lapses in operations stops with them.

I had a buddy who worked in the hanger the plane was in, so I got to see it.  This here a photo.  I did NOT take this picture:

https://imgur.com/a/f-15-hit-by-sidewinder-elmendorf-afb-RfuEL1y"
"Two aviators, one aircraft, yes?"
"I just want to say, as a Navy veteran, I hear about these gigantic Navy fuckups every now and then, like that time a Navy ship hit a cargo ship.

Conspiracies always arise from these incidents. Stories of Russian or Chinese hacking Navy ships.

I just want to say, everybody on that ship is on 6 or less hours of sleep a night, for weeks at a time, in one of the worst sleep environments you can imagine, especially on the carriers with those catapults."
"So many things have to go wrong to get to this point. The redundancy to prevent this is astounding, especially after the shoot down of Iran 655. 

Either the pilots were squawking the wrong codes, the ship wasn't picking them up for some ungodly technical reason I can't begin to think of, or they let shipmate shaky hands take over."
"*""Friendly Fire - Isn't""*"
"Well thank god they survived.

Everyone else congratulations on receiving a whole new command"
"Seems like someone was twitchy on the twitter. Could have been a misidentification. 

Hopefully not just firing missiles into a drone furball with friendlies in it."
Glad both pilots are ok. But FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK that crew on Gettysburg is gonna have multiple new assholes torn for each of them
[Simpsons Did It](https://youtu.be/0ruBLgDuWkU?si=qm9IaLwO6j_VvZB-)
Both pilots ejected and were recovered alive.
">‚Äù‚Ä¶marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen‚Äôs Houthi rebels.‚Äù

If accidentally shooting yourself is the most serious incident, it doesn‚Äôt sound like a half bad place to be stationed."
I'd never be friends with someone that shot me down
...does the military have insurace for this sort of stuff?
"Lol and people wanna get mad at forgiving student loans. 

This one incident cost taxpayers at least $150mil (probably much more)"
Everyone on the shooting ship is going to get riiiiped the fuck apart. also 100% chance a certain sect of people will be blaming DEI
How long until someone's drunk uncle says this was drone related?
"Well, I would say that one captain has ended his career."
Is this akin to a desk pop?

"As a prior navy vet who used to work on the flight deck uploading crypto codes into the jets for IFF every day, big yikes."
Launching sidewinder missile. Missed him. Launching second sidewinder missile‚Ä¶
Jesus they just shoot down any plane that flies near a missle cruiser that they can‚Äôt identify? Are they supposed to do that?
"*Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent ‚Äúfriendly fire‚Äù incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen‚Äôs Houthi rebels.*

Is the AP throwing shade here? It seems like very subtle shade. Like the most dangerous situation we‚Äôve had our guys in is when they are in our own sights."
So isn‚Äôt there a way some kind of radar or beacon of sorts could tell that it was a friendly plane before they fired a missile at it?
At least it wasn't an airliner this time...
NCIS bout to be in *ALL* their shit. Even the spare zyn stashes.
"Oh man, so many safety briefs."
Real Patlabor 2 moment.
"The CO'S career is over, they will never captain a ship again. Same with the XO. Combats department head is fucked. Division Officers head will roll, the chief will never be able to show is face in the chiefs mess again. The LPO will never make chief. The dumbass FC2 or FC3 that caused this might see Leavenworth."
Did the planes not have IFF tags and/or were they flying outside their flight corridors? How does a fuckup like this happen?
Not very friendly sounding to me
Is that what happened or are they saving face?
Oh boy. Habitual Line Crosser's next post will be a big one!
"I wonder if the rebels actually shot down the plane but the Navy is claiming responsibility to prevent the Houthis from knowing they were successful. I think it‚Äôs *SUPER* unlikely since they‚Äôve got drones and whatnot, so if the Houthis hit something they‚Äôd probably know it and try to claim credit. But the only thing the Navy loses in this case is reputation, and denies the enemy Intel. 

I need a nap, rereading this makes me sound insane"
Only 50 million dollars down the drain.  At least the pilots survived.
This business will get out of control.
"That's really revealing.  The Carrier Group is the most advanced weaponry on the planet.  Either they're lying that it's friendly fire or they had to disable some serious safety devices to deal with low-tech rocket attacks.  Either way the so-called rebel group is doing way better than they should be against a katrillion dollar carrier group.  

On that note, how are you still a rebel group after being in control of the capitol for 10 years?  Isn't that just... the government?"
They scrambled those jets alright.
"So...so many things had to go wrong for this to happen that a LOT of people are about to end up in very uncomfortable court marshals 

I am however interested to know if there was a hostile aircraft in the sky because that is really the deciding factor between a procedure fuck up and someone spending a long time in a military jail"
"That‚Äôs my ship (just left before deployment).

Quite embarrassing and I would imagine it‚Äôs VERY uncomfortable onboard right now (it should be)."
"This is why ""friendly fire"" is the most dangerous enemy. It's a wild mix of fatigue, miscommunication, and the chaos of combat that leads to these colossal mistakes. Everyone involved is in for a rough time, but at least the pilots walked away. The fallout from this will be brutal."
A kill is a kill. Paint it on the bridge and mark it in he ledger.
How the fuck did they target their own aircraft? Aren't there electronic squawkers to indicate friendly?
"How the fuck are houthi rebels able to shoot 17 anti ship cruise missiles a day , like where they getting this shit from ?"
And what did US soldiers do in Red Sea?
Or the Yemeni rebels downed their jet and they're too embarrassed to admit it.
"This makes not the fuckall most bit of sense...

""But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become, with ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area.""

""The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen‚Äôs Houthi rebels at the time of the friendly fire incident, though the U.S. military‚Äôs Central Command did not elaborate on what the pilots‚Äô mission was and did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.""

So which is it, friendly fire, we started shit so they shot back, or vice versa? This sounds dumb af. I dunno anything about over there but this article just sucks."
"Cost of the jet, a two-seat F-18, is about $68 million excluding any armament it carried."
How do we accidentally do this?
someone mislabeled the GCCS #oops
"""So *that's* what that button does"""
I assume it was Israel. Without reading the article.
"They‚Äôre alive.

And I like how the article is constantly trying to tie it back to the Houthis making things dangerous, when the most dangerous thing to Americans is America itself. 

More Americans die at the hands of other Americans than from any other danger on this earth."
"The AP should be better than this.  One pilot was shot down.  Additionally, a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) was also shot down.  If they didn't want to be so specific, they could say the jet's crew or aircrew.

While it is possible for a pilot to be in the rear seat of an F-18, they aren't doing it on deployment in the middle of a hot zone."
"‚ÄúHowever, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II.‚Äù

Did we forget Vietnam, Korea, Desert Storm?"
I‚Äôm so confused on how this could happen. What fighter jet did the person who authorized this think they were shooting down?!?!?
"In 1983, as the Duty Electronics Technician, I would mechanically enter the daily Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) code (from an uncopiable red and black code sheet book) into a pushrod programmer that uploaded today's IFF into the Tactical Air Navigation System (TACAN) so we wouldn't shoot our own aircraft.

I hope the Navy has upgraded and fool proofed their IFF code entry system. A sleepy sailor can make mistakes."
"How tf do you shoot down your own people while also allowing 100+ ""unknown"" drones fly over your country airspace and refuse to shoot those down. America is fucking stupid man."
What‚Äôs the likelihood the Houthis are responsible but Centcom is pushing the friendly fire narrative?
another uss liberty incident from our greatest ally?
How did they survive getting hit?!

Or two pilots will get their hand slapped about making sure their IFF is turned on.
I can hear Gene Hackman losing his shit right now.
"Heads are going to roll over this for sure, someone's career is over and a bunch of others are at risk. That's how my buddy who served on the recent tour of the Ike described the likely outcomes when he posted the news earlier in discord. If one of the escorts had shot down one of his boat's jets like this, it's one of the few things that probably would have made Chowdah Hill lose his cool"
At least it wasnt a passenger plane‚Ä¶.
"Yep. Someone's ass is getting chewed, and that's just the appetizer."
"Imagine being an HT though. Everyone is getting their ass chewed out on the bridge and in combat, but you are just ""doing PMS"" on the septic tank that's furthest away from the bridge for 12 hours a day so you don't attract the ire of soon to be canned officers.

Any OS is in pure hell right now though."
That'll be an embarrassing Gettysburg Address
"I bet the vibe is really cool, calm, and collected onboard the Gettysburg right now."
So many ass chewings and uncomfortable phone calls.
Fuck. My buddy stands MSS on that ship‚Ä¶
wow that's nuts. I know some of the guys on the Truman!! So glad those pilots are alive and ok. The energy on that ship must be insane right now

"In the Air Force, Egress maintains the seats/canopies and they‚Äôd be getting a bottle or a case of beer at minimum. The gift they gave the pilots was their life"
Shouldn‚Äôt the pilots give the people who make the ejection seats a watch instead?
"I've been told that ejection is just trading certain death for probable death. 

Hats off to anyone who has made that decision and lived to fly another day."
Context on the watch thing? Is this common knowledge?
Was in a squadron that had an ejection. Pilot got a plaque with the seat rope and the CDI from the seat shop who last inspected the seat got one as well.
Believe it or not they actually have to pay for the Martin Baker ejection watch. The ejection means they now get the opportunity to purchase it.
They get the opportunity to buy the watch. Not free.
i would not want to be any officer on that boat right now.
"Bremont made a watch that was exclusive to pilots who'd been ejected. Jimmy Fallon did this for his father-in-law.

Most US military deaths are friendly fire. That's the most American thing ever. Nobody kills our soldiers like we do üòÇ
"That's not gonna save those who were responsible for the fuck up, but maybe it'll lessen the blow a little."
I don't think their firing will be very friendly
Sounds like they already were.
"Out of a cannon, into the sun"
F-15s really are the tanks of the sky. Takes a hit from a sidewinder and still makes it home. Amazing.
"The US killing allies during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was pretty bad. I vaguely remember two incidents happening within a week of each other. The general undertone was confusion and anger about how that even happened, particularly since it always seemed to be the US' fault and no other nation was accidentally killing allies."
Thanks for sharing!
Damn. I used to live on JBER growing up and never heard of that.

"1. Do military birds squawk in active combat zones? 2. If there were hostile aircraft/drones/missiles in or around the area, would it really be as difficult as shooting down a civilian craft in your own airspace during ""peace"" time?"

Will bet any money its  the same story as the crashes in Japan a few years ago. Crews who are way overworked and jumpy in a hot area.
">Could have been a misidentification.

The article seems to point to that. They had been engaging incoming drones when the FA-18 was launched from the Truman. Gettysburg for still unknown reasons engaged the FA-18.  Gettysburg and Truman would have been linked via radar and comms. No idea how the Gettysburg would have mistaken an FA-18 for a drone but with an exhausted twitchy sailor anything is possible."

I mean.... it kinda was. They'd just shot down a bunch of Houthi drones in the article and seems to be the implied reason for the mistake.
"Well Christmas is only 4 days away.. so at max, 4 days. But I'm sure it'll be much less than that"
If you read the article you‚Äôd know it probably was. They‚Äôd recently shot down dozens of Houthi drones that were attempting to attack their ships.

"Can confirm that Mode 4 was not updated.

Mode 4 went away.  It's all Mode 5 now."
" Considering the technological imbalance, it probably is the most serious threat."
Unfortunately the statistics on ‚ÄúFriendly Fire‚Äù aren‚Äôt as low as we‚Äôd like them to be in general.
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs shade. Just illustrating the threat against USN is pretty low by the Houthis. They‚Äôre mostly a threat to cargo ships and Israel, I guess"
"Yes, they're supposed to have IFF systems (identify friend or foe).  So the question now is, why didn't they work?"
Lack of sleep
"More service members die by suicide than anything else, doesn't make the Red Sea any less dangerous than it is."
There has to be a point to that rant but I sure can't find it :(
Huh. I would have thought it was heart disease or cancer (because it is).
Wouldn‚Äôt that be the case for *any* military during peace time?
"If the US and allied militaries weren‚Äôt trying to contain the situation, the threat posed by the Houthi attacks would be quite blatant."
"They wouldn't be there if the Houthis weren't shooting at civilian freighters from everyone's merchant marine, not just ours. This incident happened during an enemy attack with kamikaze drones and anti-ship missiles, we are not the aggressors here no matter how badly you try to make it so."
There weren't huge naval battles during those conflicts. Probably because those countries didn't have boats.
The Houthis released a press statement a few hours ago claiming responsibility.
"The radar should have recognized the planes as US Navy aircraft, wonder how they fucked that up."
It usually takes multiple fuckups by multiple people for something like this to happen. Probably comes down to too many people skipping steps and expecting the system to pick up their slack.
"There were IR signatures all over our AFV's but the A-10 pilot still made a pass with it's 20mm in Afghanistan.

Thank God for the SF medics that came running."
Even better I'm sure everything has IFF so should have been dummy proof
"Worse, the Houthis have no manned aircraft..."
"It's possible, but it's far more likely that someone or some people in the kill-chain made an error. There's far more to signing off a weapon engagement that ""is the dot red or green?"" Its a process. The boat leadership is 100% getting canned as a principle."
"There's so much to talk about here, and a huge load for the investigation that will inevitably happen.

There's lots of possibilities, but yes it could be a result of a level of equipment failure. But even regardless of that, if you're combat watchstanders on either/both ships, it's wild for this to happen.

There's a potential factor for Gettysburg watchstanders of ""oh fuck is this a plane/missile headed towards us?""; which even that sounds unreasonable to me given the knowledge and tools we have, but I also don't want to pretend to know it all. I haven't been on one of these ships in the last year."
"No, it's both. IFF can't fire independently and also requires expressed permissions to engage. The operator is just a trigger. This is a colossal fuck up at the command level."
It‚Äôs highly likely that IFF would have been off. ¬†
For some maybe. Definetly not for the CO and XO of the Gettysburg though (at a minimum).
Or a coffee stained air boss that wants some butts.
Someone is going to be lucky if all they're flying is rubber dog shit after this.
There's video of the incident you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ruBLgDuWkU&ab_channel=SimpsonsClips)
"I was confused by the phrase 'Chowdah Hill' and looked it up. Apparently it's the name of the captain of an US aircraft carrier? 
Are we living in a Micheal Bay movie?"
Yep. The Commanding Officer is done. He‚Äôll be driving a desk for the rest of his career.
"A lot of head probably -  hell even the tech department guys flight deck guys - systems check guys. 

there are a series of safety that ALL need to fail for this to happen - the least of which is Transponder FOF systems that should tag the planes are friendly in any comms officers system . The second back up is a broadcast ID that should be picked up by the ship and cross checked automatically against a database of US flight profiles. 

the 3rd of which is a daily briefing of flight ops which is then relayed to the entire battlegroup crew .  

The SERIES of failures on this is insane .  Its like the crew on Gettysburg were all sleeping and the radar tone went off and they all panicked."
Vincennes‚Ä¶. Cursed
The passenger plane was at least coming from a potentially hostile direction.
"That could probably result in jail not an ass chewing. Negligent discharge can result in NJP (article 15) up to court martial depending on the severity, but friendly fire is not treated trivially in the military at all. It usually automatic jail time."
The ship Captain‚Äôs career is over. May as well put in his resignation now.
Combat Systems department on there is probably in shambles rn.
"HT, PMS, OS.. Yes yes. They sure are pretty letters. All written by someone who is trying to communicate to other people on the internet."

Every sailor who was off duty in their rack is going the chapel today. They are also keeping their heads down and mouths shut.
Well he‚Äôs going to have an interesting story when they get home.
This is quite possibly a career killer for a dozen different people.
"Not to worry, the VA is always there to determine that the cause of their ejector seat injuries were not related to their active duty"
"Glad the guys are ok. My GPA ejected 3 times over the course of his career, I can‚Äôt imagine going through that as a pilot"
Yikes I never thought of that before. I imagine it could destroy folks backs.
If it goes off at all. That‚Äôs apparently been a recurring issue with a couple suppliers
I mean not ejecting was almost for sure a career killer.
Better to have your career dead than to be actually dead though!
Upper leg too long? above the knee amputation it is!
"That's not really common with newer ejection seats. The oldest ones were literal cannons that shot you out of the jet and that was... rough... but seats quickly moved to being rocketed out with the acceleration spread much more evenly.

So even if it's still a very violent process permanent injury is much rarer."
Id rather the career die than the person.
"I know they get a caterpillar pin from MB too. The caterpillar concept comes from ""hitting the silk"" parachute after an ejection. I used to know a guy who had one of the MB pins. He was a midshipman on a summer tour, having chosen aviation. He was taken for a ride in a T-2 Buckeye (or at least I'm pretty sure that's what it was)."
Any stories of the seat going off in a hangar or when testing? Morbid curiosity..
The people who made the ejection seat won‚Äôt be a inch or two shorter after this
The pilots have to buy the watch
"Nah, the seats are very safe when you consider the violent acceleration. The biggest danger these days with ejecting is leaving the aircraft in a poor attitude, like being steeply banked too low above the surface. Even significant injuries these days are fairly uncommon. I saw a pilot the day after he ejected from a Tomcat in a flat spin. He was fine except for his eyes - they were totally bloodshot."
"Of course they are ""dangerous"" by necessity, but you actually have to be very unlucky to die in an ejection these days. Unless you're already severely injured or the aircraft is in extreme condition.

The tale of ""you only have two ejections before you get kicked out for spinal health"" is also no longer true (if it ever was - I believe it never was a true ""rule"" and more of a general assumption in the early days of ejection seats).

Martin Baker, primary ejection seat supplier of US aircraft, claims to have over 7000 lifes saved so far. The F-35 had something like 10 ejections so far, none of which ended fatal. Only a single F-35 pilot has died yet (a Japanese pilot in 2019), apparently diving into the sea due to disorientation in low visibility, without attempting to eject."

Both did. Only one had minor injuries.

The downside of relying on a strategy that heavily prioritizes airstrikes I suppose.
"No you put a bunch of 19-25 years Olds alone with a bunch if deadly weapons with boredom and exhaustion routine you're gonna end up with few dozen deaths each year statistically. Doesn't matter if it's combat areas or not.¬†


I think vehicular accidents are a bigger killer than weapons death, after you remove suicide, which is its own bugbear"
"Interesting. I can't find a single source that confirms what you say.

Have you tried writing novels instead of Reddit posts?"
See: The Civil War
Can‚Äôt believe this completely false statement has so many upvotes
I'd say it's more testament about how well the US military cares for and keeps it's personnel alive. The fact that unlikely scenarios kills the most is a good thing.
Followed closely by the IDF.
"Is this for real? 

While I was in Kunar in all my friends who were kia died by enemy gunfire and IED's

Weird."
"No, A10's are the tanks of the sky. They're built with so many redundancies they can take a lot of punishment. F-15's are more like the A10's of the sky. /s"
Well it was kinda both sides being wrong. The US was way too aggressive but the British were struggling to keep allies in the loop. The Americans saw someone not on the map and went in to attack. A10s are really bad at modern combat.
"I noticed in the article: ""The replacement tail came from an F-15 that had recently hit a mountainside.""

I wonder if that was the plane that hit Mount Susitna a few months earlier? 

We lost an F-15 that crashed into Mount Susitna, but could not find the pilot for quite some time.  It turns out the slope of the mountain was very gentle where it crashed and the plane almost ""slid in"".  Somehow the ejection mechanism fired during impact and the pilot's body was a few hundred yards away buried in snow.  It took months, as I recall, until they found the body.

I think the plane was ""mostly"" intact.  Photos showed the tail standing tall after the crash."
Thank you! Read the article and was still unsure.
From VFA-11 ‚ÄúRed Rippers‚Äù
Is it a ‚Äúcommand failure‚Äù when that‚Äôs just how the Navy operates?
"Yes, most military planes squawk an encrypted IFF signal to prevent fratricide like this."
"That‚Äôs essentially what IFF is. Identify friend or foe. Some sorta operational code is set. X interrogates Y. Y gives a code back. If Y gives the right operational code friendly. If not right code then bogey. It only identifies friendlies, incorrect code or incorrect response does not mean bandit/hostile."
"It's not regular squawking like a civil pilot will do, military aircraft have more specific and complex IFF stuff. 

But, frankly, F-18s could have been completely dark and still assumed friendly *because Houthis don't have aircraft*."

I remember reading about sleep deprivation on navy vessels. Those people are at their posts for too long.¬†
"It really sounds like the Tig was on ""fire on anything that flies in our AOO"" AEGIS mode and they simply didn't switch it off."
"Last week I accidentally threw out a can of orange safety paint at work and my boss was a litlle pissed at me for wasting $40. I assume shooting down a very expensive, tax-payer funded F-18 and almost killing two of your buddies with a missile is probably a few notches higher on the fuck up ladder."
"How are all those people involved in the process that resulted in this incident? Like, do they all need to fuck up for this to happen?"
"I‚Äôm looking@TAO, they have overall command in CIC. Most definitely an Admirals mast/inquiry. Every piece of information/evidence in CIC gets seized."
Article says they just took off. It takes a little bit of time before the system can determine that the radar tracks and iff tracks are the same
They hate America.
"That gets in the way of the ""America bad"" argument."
If I had to take a guess a tired or inexperienced OS probably got confused started panicking that missiles were coming in and the TAO just took them at their word for some reason.
"That's not how the SPY loop on AEGIS works. SPY picks up a track and IFF interrogates it. If it doesn't provide IFF returns, CND will assume hostile, depending on the rules input at the console. In hostile conditions, US and coalition aircraft squawk on an encrypted military channel, which should inhibit the AEGIS system from firing on friendly aircraft, but if I had to guess, two things happened here: the aircraft was not squawking any IFF, or was in the wrong IFF mode, and the CG had rules set up to auto fire on any unidentified aircraft within a certain physical perimeter."
"Just like everything else in our current world‚Ä¶‚Äùoh, so and so will get it‚Ä¶.‚Äù"
The US navy turns off their brains whenever Iran is involved for whatever reason.
"You mean the GAU-8? I thought it was 30mm?

Either way damn lucky. Soft targets in the path of one of those pretty much can fit through a sieve after."
Any chance you can please explain this with less jargon? Or link me to something that would?
This might literally boil down to a lot of bullshit lined up at the wrong time and shit happened.
The article says they had flown a number of drone attacks earlier. My guess is some station was low on sleep and high on adrenaline and fired without thinking or double-checking. Incredibly stupid to say the least.
"Exactly This! Zero Manned Air Breathing Platforms! Duh. Not to mention the CIC "" Big  Board"" on the Aegis does everything except Play Wagner and the Hornets would have been Squawking as Friendlies.

Also USS-Vincennes (CG-49)"
"What kind of career opportunities exist for leadership dismissed over friendly fire incidents like this?


Are they just going to be in a cozy high-paying civilian job in three weeks? Or are they going to have the shame follow them?"
What is the punishment in this situation? Who is fucked and how fucked are they? How many levels of fuck are being addressed here?
"To expand on that: IFF is just one part of a multi-layered system. 

The general term is Deconfliction. It's the coordination between all friendly air-related units to ensure that every relevant party knows where to expect friendlies and where not.

IFF as an automated ally-recognition system is one of the last layers of defense against friendly fire, if the situation is chaotic and human coordination has failed. It can and should not be relied on."
Shit flows uphill in situations such as this.

Damn the Gettysburg was a piece of shit when I saw it. Not at all surprised it was involved in this fuck up.

He‚Äôs famous for his social media presence and being a propaganda piece. He bakes cookies for his crew and does mini photo op interviews where he invites them to the bridge and gives them a cookie while they sit in the captains chair.
It‚Äôs pronounced CHOWDEHHH

There wont be a ‚Äúrest of career‚Äù. Only thing in his future is a early retirement.

"An Air Force pilot once shot down a Navy jet sort of on purpose and the guy stayed in, made O6, and nearly made flag.

Punishment is wacky in the military"
The US Navy once shot down an airliner killing all 290 onboard with zero repercussions to the crew that did it. They will be fine.
Poor IFF tech is going through some shit.
Poor MSS is probably loosing their minds right now
FCA's gotta be trying to be invisible while pushing blame on the OS's... absolutely would NOT wanna be the RSC operator for that
"I'm not going to bother looking anything up, and I lack any sort of relevant military experience, but from context I'm going to guess HT = hygiene technician, PMS = preventive maintenance (PMs = plural form of PM), and OS = officer of some sort but I'm not sure what"
"lol I was thinking the same thing. Like, not all of us are in the US military here üòÇ"
Captain's gonna go. Weapons div officer is gonna go.  OODs gonna get masted back into chevrons and there's probably a few watch standers operating in fire control who made some kind of clerical error on a log book with in the 2 or 3 hours prior to the incident who will also get caught up in it so the Navy can solidify an operator error narrative.
Heads will roll.
Preexisting ejection seat injuries
"Best phrase I ever heard regarding the VA was something like this.

‚ÄúThe VA, giving our veterans a second chance to die for our country.‚Äù"
Pretty sure the VA does not fuck around as much when it comes to officers. And all pilots are officers (save for some warrant officers in the Army).
"Isn't that the limit, or is that just a rumor?"
"It is incomparably better than dying 

But permanent injury due to a mistake must be awful, especially for people who probably spent their lives learning to do this thing. I never planned to fly a jet."
The spinal compression has made multiple pilots inches shorter.
"I had heard of accident in the maintenance wing, but they usually involved high pressured things rapidly decompressing and people losing limbs and digits (people being dumb or careless usually)‚Ä¶.thankfully I don‚Äôt think there were any hiccups with the ejection seats and accidents in general were fairly rare.

He served for 32 years and retired when they started to force him to work on the C-130s lol. He hated those things. He was really good at what he did though and had many commendations."
">The biggest danger these days with ejecting is leaving the aircraft in a poor attitude

The friendliest of fire
Still checks out. No one kills our soldiers like we do.
What‚Äôs really sad is how lost they felt in life to feel the need to join the army in the first place just to realize it was a scam by their own country
By accident*
Friendly fire or straights up murder?
"Nah, when I was overseas the other unit deployed with us had a lot of friendly fire incidents from their own ground troops not support. One I recall, the Mk-19 gunner ended up hitting his own troops. After that they pulled the Mk-19 from all deployed units in our AO. 

Air strikes are generally safe. There's a range you're not allowed to call air strikes inside, and they'll circle the target to confirm they have the right people before they strike.

But mistakes do happen, my brother even got hit by shrapnel from naval fire. Mistakes even happen in training from time to time. Even without fire, planes crash sometimes. 

This, though? I can't understand this. They had a ton of radar, cameras, observation decks, and many more safety measures to make sure things like this don't happen. Before planes fly out they'll brief everyone involved. Either intentional or by accident the plane got targeted by troops on ship. Even that is a difficult mistake because usually there's multiple people next to anyone with access to weapons and you can see when they're pointed directly at friendly troops. With things like missiles usually you need clearance and confirmation before launching. Meaning a lot of people all fucked up in order for this to happen. 

Even moreover, usually these things get covered up and swept under the rug, military won't comment at all. The fact this made this to reliable news outlets means troops onboard reported this to the news."
Could be killing 10x more of our guys and still be the best strategy ever come up with.
That fire was anything but friendly
"A10 are solid but F15 have taken some insane punishment to make it home. One even flew after losing a wing in a head on collision.


And unlike the A-10, the F-15 is useful in a peer/near-peer conflict"
Friendly fire champ of the sky
"There were more incidents involving other aircraft than A-10 pilots mindlessly shooting at everything that moves

F-15 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Black_Hawk_shootdown_incident

F-16 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnak_Farm_incident

It almost always boil down to breakdown in established engagement rules coupled with trigger-happy pilots.

The F-15 incident was a breakdown in communications when AWACS lost track of the 2 Black Hawks, and called clear when 2 F-15 pilots spotted 2 ""Hinds"". Rules of Engagement was to identify the heli first but they somehow mistook the dark olive painted Black Hawks with GIANT AMERICAN FLAGS on the side as identification, as Iraqi Hinds (normally painted desert tan in the first place). This incident was more so on the miscoms from the AWACS but the American flag Black Hawks was pointed out.

The F-16 was even worse. The pilot, flying at 23000 ft (7000m) decided that gunfire and anti-tank fire coming from below were enemy missiles heading for him, and decided to *descend* to engage before getting cleared hot. I get pissed reading this article so I'll copy what Lieutenant General Bruce Carlson said to the pilot.

> ""You acted shamefully on 17 April 2002 over Tarnak Farms, Afghanistan, exhibiting arrogance and a lack of flight discipline. When your flight lead warned you to ""make sure it's not friendlies"" and the Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft controller directed you to ""stand by"" and later to ""hold fire"", you should have marked the location with your targeting pod. Thereafter, if you believed, as you stated, you and your leader were threatened, you should have taken a series of evasive actions and remained at a safe distance to await further instructions from AWACS. Instead, you closed on the target and blatantly disobeyed the direction to ""hold fire."" Your failure to follow that order is inexcusable. I do not believe you acted in defense of Major Umbach or yourself. Your actions indicate that you used your self-defense declaration as a pretext to strike a target, which you rashly decided was an enemy firing position, and about which you had exhausted your patience in waiting for clearance from the Combined Air Operations Center to engage. You used the inherent right of self-defense as an excuse to wage your own war."""
Was less the brits and more ANA / ISF.
"Yeah, for sure. The Navy isn't a force of nature, it's a system designed by and run by man. If the system is designed for failure, those in command have failed"
Absolutely. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how we‚Äôve always done it‚Äù has never and should never protect a CO from a bad policy.¬†
They do have drones and missiles though.
"While I was still in the Navy, there was a surface vessel collision in 2017 that cited Sleep Deprivation as a root cause of the incident. I recall our command took a morning for a stop work (we were in dry-dock preparing for a Reactor coolant filter media change out, not on deployment) to discuss sleep Deprivation, underway routines, etc... I always felt the effort was nice, but the end result was that a bunch of good-ole-boy, back-in-my-day types were selected by the command to run the show and it turned into the biggest NUB hating clusterfuck I've ever seen, rather than taking on any legitimate concerns for review or consideration.

It was one of those things that it was ""nice"" that sleep was recognized as a legitimate cause of human error, but shitty that we all knew 100% that absolutely nothing would change (certainly not for engineering at any rate)."
Pilots get mandatory rest periods but the guys driving the ships and those sitting as TAO do not. And then we wonder why those things happen.
Yeah I would say so but not by much. You‚Äôre on thin fucking ice buddy for throwing away $40. You‚Äôre a borderline monster lol
"CO - Commanding Officer. Captain of the ship. Responsible for everything.

XO - Executive Officer. Pretty much the same as the CO.

CMC - Command Master Chief. Highest ranking enlisted and part of the unholy trinity.

Basically, their job is to be responsible.

CSO - Combat Systems Officer, responsible for all combat systems, including fire control.

OPS - Operations Officer, responsible for operations.

WEPS - Weapons Officer, probably the least culpable and will probably get off the easiest. They're basically CSO's bitch and they'll get dragged down with them.

TAO - Tactical Action Officer. This is a position that changes between shifts. This person is the one responsible for coordinating pretty much everything and the incident is their fault. The people above them are responsible for making sure the TAO can do their job and are responsible for their actions, but the TAO is the one who made the mess.

There's also going to be some junior officers that get the hammer as well depending on the investigation. Communications officer could be wrapped up in this if there was an issue comms for example. Some of the more senior enlisted might get dragged down too.

Majority I described are officers and it's their job to work together to ensure things like this don't happen. These investigations also tend to have cascading effects due to everything that happened before during and after is under a microscope. That's where the junior enlisted usually get in trouble.

So yeah, to answer basically all those people are meant to be checks for one another. When it fails, they all are responsible for the failure."
My bet is they were off of approved flight corridors and flying with a broken IFF transponder. Because just one of those would not get enough points to warrant engagement.

I assume (completely off the top of my ass) that it can detect condensation and contrail type stuff left behind a jet engine? 

I do think the newest Shaheed is a jet though, the 238. And the one that Iran reverse engineered off of the one we crashed. No way either of those are confusable with a F-18 though."
"They‚Äôll lose their command and possibly a demotion, not ejected from the military. If their conduct was criminal they‚Äôll face a court martial, if not criminal they‚Äôll get an article 15 as well. A dishonorable discharge without a court martial is impossible because it‚Äôs punitive, they just get knocked down in rank/pay and moved to a job with far less consequential responsibilities. Depending on how bad the fuck up is they may never promote again and basically be forced out of the military that way."
This is how supply officers are commissioned.

Yeah i was gonna say. The size the US military. Im surprised we dont hear about this shit more. Obvious reasons as to why but I would imagine it happens alot more often then we think (not at this magnitude though).

It was actually two different collisions within months of each other. There were also a couple near misses.

I remember the report concluding that the mission scope of the Navy had been increasing for decades and it had gotten to the point where there simply weren‚Äôt enough sailors to conduct all of the operations they wanted. The fleet was simply stretched too thin and personnel wasn‚Äôt getting enough sleep/rest. In response, the fucking Secretary of the Navy said something along the lines of ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no excuse!‚Äù.

"The Israeli pilots who tried to sink the USS Liberty and the PT boat captains that came an hour later to fire torpedoes never got punished even though they killed 34 people, dropped napalm on the ship, and then torpedoed it while it was in international waters.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident#Attack_on_the_Liberty

LBJ tried to hide it.

From the start, the response to Israeli statements of mistaken identity ranged between frank disbelief to unquestioning acceptance within the administration in Washington. A communication to the Israeli ambassador on 10 June, by Secretary Rusk stated, among other things:

 At the time of the attack, the USS Liberty was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. ... Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air ... Accordingly, there is every reason to believe that the USS Liberty was identified, or at least her nationality determined, by Israeli aircraft approximately one hour before the attack. ... The subsequent attack by the torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life.[52][53]


George Lenczowski notes: ""It was significant that, in contrast to his secretary of state, President Johnson fully accepted the Israeli version of the tragic incident."" He notes that Johnson himself included only one small paragraph about the Liberty in his autobiography,[54] in which he accepted the Israeli explanation, **minimized the affair and distorted the number of dead and wounded, by lowering them from 34 to 10 and 171 to 100**, respectively. Lenczowski further states: ""It seems Johnson was more interested in avoiding a possible confrontation with the Soviet Union than in restraining Israel.""[55]"

"In the military, possibly everyone in the chain of command, from whoever fired the missile, whoever gave the order, to the ship‚Äôs captain even if they didn‚Äôt give the direct order."
"This guy has no clue what he was talking about.  Half the shit he said doesn‚Äôt exist nor has ever existed.  ‚ÄúFire control‚Äù as a room hasn‚Äôt existed since battleships.  

I was a qualified cic watch stander on AEGIS in multiple leadership positions, and it‚Äôs basically too early to tell.  It is very likely that the CO of Gettysburg will get fired if the ship is found at fault.  It is possible that gettysburg isn‚Äôt at fault, and that the aircraft made an unsafe maneuver, and therefore the aviators, or their chain of command, would be at fault.  

It is also possible that nobody gets fired.  If Gettysburg activated self defense stuff for a good reason, and the aircraft maneuvered in such a way to trigger that self defense stuff in combat and didn‚Äôt respect gettysburgs firepower, it could just be a lessons learned.  

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs like 90-10 that the co of Gettysburg gets fired. 

The Tactical Action Officer is a combat watchstander who is directly responsible to the CO.  If the ship fired, and he didn‚Äôt mean it to, it was that persons fault.  CO will take the blame for leading poorly because someone under them either A. Fucked up or b. Was incompetent."
"[Tldr edit up front: the US military is honestly way better at admitting to procedural, doctrinal, and organizational faults than the vast majority of companies. It also hides a lot of the punishments its members get from public eyes, though]

Some definitions first:

* ""NJP"" = ""Nonjudicial punishment"" (one step shy of a military court. Maximum sentence: 1/2 month's pay x2 and reduction in rank by 1 step)
* Court Martial: a military criminal court. Note: this bypasses double jeopardy, and you *can* be tried in Court Martial for something you were tried for in civilian court and vice versa. Maximum sentence: execution. Usual worst sentence: turning big rocks into little rocks at Fort Leavenworth for years.
* Reduction in rank = rank go down by 1 (E-5 Enlisted becomes E-4, O-5 Officer becomes O-4)
* Flag Officer = Admiral/General

Now, the meat and potatoes:

Bottom Rung Personnel (Junior Enlisted, low level officers): Usually, assuming no malign intent, the lowest level personnel get retraining, *maybe* reduction in rank (\~1 level) if the lapse in judgement was astronomically bad (error, not deliberately fucking off). If they find malign intent, possibly all the way up to Turning Big Rocks into Little Rocks (sentenced to hard labor at Leavenworth). This, obviously, still goes on their Evaluation record, even if no malign intent found.

Middle management (Senior enlisted, mid-level officers): this varies, depending on details/involvement, but possible nothing visible to the public (anywhere from a very pointed talking to from the Captain to also getting shit assignments) up to reduction in rank, and, rarely, court martial if and only if blatant disregard for regulations, safety, and sense are found.

Upper management (command-level senior enlisted \[e.g. Command Master Chief\], senior officers): Depending on involvement, possibly as little as nothing happens, possibly ""retired""/resignation. If directly involved, and blatant disregard for regs, safety, and/or sense, possibly reduction in rank. If malign intent, court martial is a possibility.

Commanding Officer: if it occurs in their command, they're responsible for it. Almost always, they get, at most, political consequences. This means it's nothing really visible to the public, but I'm talking things like getting blacklisted for promotion, losing out on 'good' future commands, and written reprimands. They may even receive punishments within the limits of Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP), which are obvious and more traditional in nature, but are also rarely disclosed to the public at any level. The most egregious cases still result in Court Martial

Flag: See ""Commanding Officer"", but even less likely to get visible punishment and more likely to get 'behind closed doors' punishment. Also an understanding of distance from the event, just like you don't blame the CEO of an international company when the parking lot guard goes on a power trip, the Admiral/General in charge doesn't really get as much touched by isolated incidents.

Note: the more pervasive the issue seems to be, the higher level the punishments tend to be focused. 1 guy fucking off gets him and maybe his supervisor in trouble. 25 guys dangerously fucking off individually across 5 different Commands gets the *Admiral* in trouble."
"No matter what, someone did fuck up. I was on a submarine so the watch structure is more consolidated into fewer positions with more responsibilities and trust/independence but if I had to make an assumption with only the information we have, the Officer of the Deck, or whatever the surface fleet equivalent is, failed to communicate with fire control that the aircraft they were tracking was theirs and then ordered it to be fired on when it entered some kind of defensive perimeter around the carrier group.

Some procedure was definitely done incorrectly. Some human errors definitely occurred. Whoever had the conn at the time of the accident is, by default, at fault. The CO will be at fault and the XO will likely as well. Anyone who was a watch stander in some kind of a supervisory role at the time of the accident in the entire weapons department will likely face some retribution. At some point in the timeline the Navy WILL be able to find instances where watch standers could have conceivably realized they were looking at friendly air craft but for whatever reason nothing was done or it went unnoticed. Whether these instances are banal and minor or glaring and obvious will not matter.

If someone had died, they would bury literally everyone down to the unqualified Seaman Apprentice radar operator sitting a training watch. The Navy, and the military in general, is obsessed with its perception. ""The Navy"" is never at fault."
"Calm down buddy. As I've said in other comments I was a submariner. Watch structure is different and chiefs frequently stand dive officer and OOD on submarines. And your right, its the weapons department. Its been about 10 years, my bad lol. I was literally keeping a paper sonar log in like 2014. I wouldn't be surprised if its electronic now but I also really wouldn't be surprised if its still paper.

New tactic for missile and drone attacks. Make them go away from the carrier group for a bit.
"A bit more complicated. Basically, as long as the order is lawful then everyone is responsible for the outcome. Engaging a target is a lawful order. The negligence could be criminal, but the order itself was lawful. So, everyone in the chain of command is responsible for it.

If your department head told you to go rape and murder your buddy, that's not a lawful order and only the department head and the person who committed the crime would be responsible. The failure is with them not the chain. 

There's going to be an investigation and the results of that will truly determine what happens but many of those senior people careers are done at the very least. Some may be going to jail."
"When being actively attacked by ASMs, the risk of not firing on a radar contact without IFF and not on a known flight plan greatly exceeds the risk of firing on one. The extent to which this is a screwup vs. friction heavily depends on details I haven‚Äôt seen. If the plane was on it‚Äôs opened route and had a working IFF it‚Äôs hard to imagine how the Gettysburg messed up that badly; if the plane was suffering electronics problems and off-route without IFF it‚Äôs pretty understandable, especially if the fighter crew didn‚Äôt realize the malfunctions."

"Why would Israel have disciplined those pilots? They followed their orders and killed Americans and crippled our ship just like they were supposed to. My understanding is that we have radio calls where they discuss the fact that they've identified the ship and receive confirmation that ~~their~~they're still supposed to attack. Israel didn't want their war crimes recorded, and if that meant declaring war on the US so be it. What I can't understand is why we keep selling weapons to our enemies like we do, and why we've never launched a significant attack on them. I mean, obviously there's their massive influence over our elections, they kicked out two members of congress this cycle, but still, a war's a war."

"IIRC, it isn't a flat number. Pretty sure it depends on a combination of post event physical exam and the number of ejections from specific airframes because they don't all use the same seats so not every ejection is necessarily done with the same force.

Holy shit
This is correct. If you pass your medical exams you're good to fly. There was a pilot who ejected at near Mach 1 speed which basically immediately obliterated his body. He recovered and flew again. No way the military wants to DNIF a pilot they invested millions in just because of a certain number of ejections
Which rarely becomes an issue nowadays since they fitted the newer models with booster seats.
"5,000.0 isn't so bad."
Command makes decisions that shape the culture
"All those people would be present in the way that they're all on board the ship and you can reach them at any time very easily. Either a phone call or page them over the intercom or send someone to go wake them up. They would still be responsible. The TAO position is a duty and those who gave them the duty are responsible. 

They're also responsible for accidents, if a weapon system malfunctioned and killed a bunch of people even though they never intended for that to happen it still did under their watch.  

So, in my original comment I said we spilled fuel. The reason it happened was due to faulty equipment and complacency. A false alarm would constantly go off due to a malfunction. People got complacent in just hitting the silence button. Well, one of those alerts wasn't false. The whole chain of command for the engineering department got their asses handed to them. Some worse than others but it wasn't a good time for anyone."

Nothing here says he had coverage for a tow. You have to pay extra for that.
"The only way he doesn‚Äôt get covered for the tow is if he doesn‚Äôt pay for roadside assistance, which costs like, 100 dollars a year *at most.*

Wow. 200 dollars a year. Stop the presses!

"it's about double that for motorcycles. 

and the first time I used roadside that came with my national auto insurer  with motorcycle insurance and roadside element-  i found out they will cover a tow anywhere on their 'list' and anywhere else is more- even if there is no motorcycle shop on the list."

Part of the policy said if there are no shops in 15 mile range, they'll take it farther....  I assumed too much...  I assumed that meant motorcycle shops.

the first time I went to claim, there were shops in range of the contract they had with a national towing company,  car shops.

That meant any overage of 15 miles was on me.

that was over $500.  I got a private tow, dropped that, picked up AAA for bikes...   it's not as expensive as a private tow was, but it's not 100 a year."

For what reason should society suffer the burden on letting free a person that indiscriminantly poisoned food available for purchase in an effort to gain clout and money? The cost-benefit analysis doesn't seem to be in society's favor."
"Someone should ""prank"" this kid by breaking his legs."
"That is not a prankster, that is a chemical attack.

They really need to start labeling things correctly for the crimes they do and stop their BS for the smaller offences... You throw the book at them, then remove the accusations that won't hold."
How was it a prank if you cannot possibly see the reaction of the person you're pranking? Would he be looking through the obituaries 'Mary died of food poisoning from cucumbers bought ar Walmart' and then claim responsibility on Tik Tok?
I don‚Äôt get these little shits today. Destructive little edgelord cunts.
Tampering with the food supply is actual terrorism.
"Let's quit calling rude / criminal behavior ""pranks"". Just so we're all on the same page, here are some examples:

Prank:

- wrap a small gift in several layers of nested boxes

- call someone and ask if their refrigerator is running

- roll of toilet paper perforated down the center instead of horizontally so it doesn't rip properly

- hand buzzer

- cricket noise maker hidden behind a bookshelf

- bouillon cube in the shower head

- ridiculous costumes in public

Not Prank:

- harassment

- spraying poison on food

- stealing

- assault / battery

- medicating someone against their will / knowledge / consent"
"I just saw the video of this on r/iamatotalpieceofshit and people in there comments were saying he should be charged with a felony

And here we are 

What a world"
"That's not a ""prank"". That's attempted murder. Wtf is wrong with people?"
"TikTok and what it has done to Gen Z/Alpha and normalizing assaults on teachers and contaminating foods, all as pranks for likes and laughs."
"GOOD, Now that should be considered an act of terrorism."
"That's considered a prank now? Jesus the bar is getting higher and the iq is getting smaller. At some point on this trajectory, we're gonna see the dumbest mother fucker from YouTube try and hijack a plane haha. I'm calling it now!"
Please charge him with something that befits the danger of the crime.  Perhaps domestic terrorism?
"Not a prank, but actual terrorism. Poisoning food with pesticides set out for mass consumption."
Maybe they should feed him some bug sprayed food in his holding cell.
A class 6 felony for ‚Äúintroducing poison‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem too serious. He was poisoning food.
"For some reason the article didn't post his face, even though he *filmed himself* and *published it online*.

[So here he is]( https://x.com/hayasaka_aryan/status/1870482941236944996/video/1)"
">He was charged with:

>Introducing Poison (Class 6 Felony).

>Criminal Damage (Class 1 Misdemeanor).

>Endangerment (Class 1 Misdemeanor).

>Theft (Class 1 Misdemeanor).

Yeah, but he sprayed multiple different products, he should get the introducing poison, criminal damage, and endangerment charges for each product he sprayed, at least."
"anyone arrested for bs socialmedia ""pranks"" should have their channels deleted and banned from the internet as part of their sentencing"
Gee I hope some prankster in prison doesn‚Äôt tamper with their food
"A prank is putting up signs in the park that point to the non-emergency exit but in fact just point in a circle.

Poisoning a population's food or water supply is in fact a recognized crime against humanity."
‚ÄúPrankster‚Äù. The media is shit.
"The feds should 100% step in and charge him with something more serious. They have jurisidiction if they want it, since his video crossed state lines.

Hope he gets nailed to the wall for this."
It'd be cool if recording your crime for views could be an enhancement but I can see why law enforcement would prefer criminals always film the evidence... I think it probably leads to more crimes overall even if it gets them a better arrest statistic.
"Administering a noxious substance, attempted murder, assault with a weapon, mischief ... throw this SOB in the can for as long as possible. The stupid look on his sneaky face when he was doing his bit should be a life sentence."
Charge one felony count per banana.
"I used to work at that store, and this is on brand for the garbage that shops there. About half the customers were the most aggravating wastes of space I've ever had to tolerate, and I'm not at all surprised they've graduated beyond from setting the store on fire."
If a foreign national did this they would legitimately call it terrorism
Thats not a prankster thats a terrorist
"That;s not a prank, that's outright psychotic"
"He's not a prankster.  Even the title of the article is wrong.. how bout... ""Man sprays poison on food.  Felony charges pending""."
This malcontent should be forced to eat the food he poisoned
Why not attempted murder charges for each one sprayed? Set legal precedence that system will bury them and others who think this is a thing to do.
All crimes should have ‚Äúdone to produce media content‚Äù as a massively aggravating factor that ups the punishment
"Dude is almost 30 and he's pulling this shit? 

I hope he enjoys prison.

What a waste of his future...and for what?! 

Nothing is to be gained from this."
Prankster is a funny way of saying Bio-Terrorist‚Ä¶
That's a poisoning.  How can this be anything other than assault?
"‚ÄúPrankster?‚Äù
Attempted murderer"
Never knew attempted murder was considered a prank.
"Is this really a prank though?

I'm not expert on the subject, but isn't this pushing towards terrorism than a prank?"
"So Luigi gets labeled a terrorist but this person is a prankster?

Wtf?"
[removed]
Hope they throw the book at him and make it stick
"Only a class 6 felony? That's only 18 months in prison. Hope they stack up the other penalties, for another 18 months."
"That‚Äôs not a prank, that‚Äôs bioterrorism."
That isn‚Äôt a prank. Spraying pesticide on produce is terrorism. Lock him up.
Sounds like terrorism to me!
"Little kids could eat the food. This is not a prank, this guy deserves serious time. These idiots need to see consequences."
pretty sure this is that same guy who poured ice in the deep fryer of a restaurant pls send this idiot away
"That‚Äôs not a ‚Äúprank‚Äù it‚Äôs 

Introducing Poison (Class 6 Felony).  
Criminal Damage (Class 1 Misdemeanor).  
Endangerment (Class 1 Misdemeanor).  
Theft (Class 1 Misdemeanor).  


He should spend time in jail for his actions."
"Yeah this ain't a prank bro


This is a crime


Both for the danger to others and the wasted food"
I guess prankster is another name for domestic terrorist
~~Prankster~~ Piece of shit asshole
"Prankster, that's what we're going with? Is it 2015 again, ""just a prank, bro""?"
"""Prankster"", I think they mean Poisoner"
"    Introducing Poison (Class 6 Felony)

    Criminal Damage (Class 1 Misdemeanor)

    Endangerment (Class 1 Misdemeanor)

    Theft (Class 1 Misdemeanor)

This is what they got him for, with this incident. I wonder if they will further charge him for his other activities in his older videos."
"The word they are looking for is vandal, not prankster."
"Tampering with consumer products is a 5-20 year sentence if charged and convicted under US Code ¬ß1365. This covers tampering at any stage up to and including holding for sale. The ""class 6"" state felony charge is being exceptionally merciful in comparison."
"This isn't a ""prankster"", this is an asshole. In a prank, no one gets hurt, and pesticide will most certainly hurt some people. Poisoning people is a crime, you dipshit. This is a felony and I hope they throw the book at him."
The term ‚ÄúPrankster‚Äù needs to go away. Most of it is a form of assault or destruction of private property. They‚Äôre just Shitbags who enjoy watching others suffer humiliation.
People don't know what a prank is anymore.
That was attempted murder not a prank
"Pretty sure poisoning people isn't ""just a prank"""
"That isn't a prank, it's bio-terroism."
"I wonder if federal charges can also be filed here. I recently bought ant bait and saw the label about federal law regarding bug sprays/poisons. 

> It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling."
What we call things reveals the quality of our cultural character. We are diseased.
"While this obviously goes well beyond the typical ‚Äúprank‚Äù, all these little pukes need harsher punishments. Many of these cowards target women and the elderly because they‚Äôre chicken shits. A big problem is people don‚Äôt bother to raise their spoiled brats with any kind of respect for the rest of society and worse, defend their actions when the law is brought in. I recall the guy that got shot in the food court hassling a food delivery driver. Fortunately, the service worker was not charged and the pos lived but to hear his mother defend and continue to support the useless turd she shat out just makes me sick."
Not a prank. An act of terrorism.  Prison time.
Maybe they should charge him with terrorism!
He should be charged with attempted murder.
Well is the prankster going to be charged with terrorism?
"""Prankster"" arrested for spraying pesticide on Walmart produce

fixed the title for you"
Throw the book at this prick
"I believe this type of offense was made a federal crime after someone tampered with Tylenol capsules in a supermarket by lacing them with cyanide, leading to deaths (1982?). Resulted in Federal Anti-tampering act, making it a federal offense to alter consumer products - similar to this guy spraying what is essentially poison on loose product that would be bought and consumed by unsuspecting people. It could lead to all unpackaged fruit and veg having to be wrapped like the Tylenol case led to the creation of tamper-evident packaging."
All pranks need to be labeled as criminal assault. So tired of these idiots
Violence upon him for attempt mass murder.
Trying to poison people.
That's not a prank. Doing something bad doesn't mean it's a prank.
Fucking with food should be considered worth pursuing by law enforcement. A person who would do this shouldn't get any breaks.
"um where are the rest of the charges. Feds your up.
Federal law
In the United States, tampering with a consumer product is a second-degree felony under 18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1365. The penalty for this crime can include: 
Up to 10 years in prison for tampering without injury 
Up to 20 years in prison for tampering that results in serious injury 
Up to life in prison for tampering that results in death 
Up to $10,000 in fines"
Mass poisoner arrested for terrorist attack
"This piece of shit knew he was spraying poison on food that was being sold to a lot of different demographics. It could have gone to kids, elderly people, those with compromised organs... this should be attempted murder imo. You don't poison food if you don't have intent to end someone's life, or at the very least, having reasonable knowledge that it's likely someone could die if they ingested it."
Don't ever fuck with people's food.
Public flogging seems an apt punishment.
"Pretty soon all produce will be under plexiglass, locked down, thanks to immature dinks like him."
"Active ingredient in what he sprayed can cause convulsions, among other things"
"I wish the media would not use these words just because that's how the suspect identify as. If the perp claimed to be ""pick up artist"" and raped somebody, would it make sense for the press to write ""pick up artist arrested for rape""? No. Because this isn't ""pick up art"", whatever the hell it means, it's rape.

This guy is not ""a prankster"", he tried to literally poison people and he might have caused some death. This isn't a prank, he committed a crime, and if he did it for views, thus for profit, it's should be an aggravating circumstance in a commission of the crime nothing more.

Then the media wonders why people don't take them seriously anymore... that's why, the way you report is simply disgusting and gives journalism a bad name."
"Attempted administering a noxious substance? And if he had a camara guy etc then conspiracy for all of them. 

Welcome to club fed."
That‚Äôs not a prankster more like a terriost
"So how is this not considered terrorism with a chemical weapon?
I mean, if one person says deny, defend, delay on the phone and is charged with terrorism, this clearly qualifies as such."
"Just like we discourage publishing/publicizing various manifestos, social media should automatically bury such content and ban the creator(s)."
He‚Äôs not a prankster. He has a history of dangerous assault and harassment.
Sounds like attempted murder to me
"Like bro what's the prank, that's poisoning random people"
Think you spelled domestic terrorism incorrectly.
"~~pankster~~ Asshole, living bag of shit arrested for spraying pesticide on Walmart produce

FIFY

I watched some of this video, lock this guy up forever, and forget about him."
Wouldn't that be considered terrorism? Tainting the food supply?
Someone needs to enact some street justice
"That‚Äôs not a prankster, that‚Äôs a criminal. A felon. A POS that deserves to go away for good."
This is attempted mass murder.
"Social Media platforms should be liable for the dissemination of content that depicts criminal behavior. They‚Äôre abetting anti social behavior for monetary gain. Prior to the advent of these Social Media platforms and their monetizing practices, this behavior was not seen by more than a handful of individuals. Now it‚Äôs spread across the internet being exposed to potentially thousands. Free Speech is not without consequences, just as other Constitutional protections are subject to scrutiny."
You mean domestic terrorist. Fixed  the headline.
"He sprayed rotisserie chickens as well as produce?!  That‚Äôs not a prank, not even close.  No reasonable person would think so.  This is straight up attempted assault."
"I said it before, but people are way too comfortable with not getting punched/punished for being stupid nowadays."
Dude is about to find out how good of a sense of humor the FDA has
Can we stop calling these people pranksters?
I could see if it was an 11yo. But this is a grown a$$ man. I think people who mess with the food supply should be shot. End of story.
If I ever learned my kid was doing this I woul absolutely die. Then walk his ass down to the station and turn him In!!
"I‚Äôm amazed it took this long, he‚Äôs been doing this for ages"
Have you seen his mugshot? The only actual prank was him pranking himself with that haircut.
Could you imagine what all of those poor Walmart workers had to do. I wonder if they called the police to come in to put yellow tape around all of the produce so that way no one could accidentally buy it. Because that sounds like a nightmare.
I bet he‚Äôll be popular in prison.  These are felony charges.
Not a prankster. A poisoner.
"You can get permanent kindney and neurological damage, dementia later in life plus so much more shit, hope the guys gets the book thrown on him what an asse"
"bury him under the prison, please set a precedent for this type of nonsense"
"He was making $6000 to $10,000 per month from his pranks.

Once he gets out of prison, he will have to find a real job.

He will be banned from posting to social media for a long, long time."
"I was waiting for this, he did rotisserie chickens you eat without prep"
"You say ""prank"", I say ""attempted manslaughter""."
Prankster? How about criminal.
That‚Äôs not a prank that‚Äôs a serious crime.
Don't worry people who do bad things get pardoned.
Nail him for terrorism too!
"Not so much a ""prank"" as ""attempted murder"", IMO."
"I just had some early teens goofing around the mall I work part time at.  Another customer later came up to me and said they walked out with unpaid merchandise.  I'm pretty sure one of them was filming their exploits for social media as well.

At this point, I'm 100% in favor of a social media ban for those under 16.  If possible, I'd extend that to smart phones in general.  They can use flip phones to call and text until then.

In addition, I'd find some form of productive punishment for petty theft.  I'm not trying to ruin their future with a rap sheet, but some minors are aware that they can get away with more due to their age, and exploit that fact.  I figure if they have time to act like reckless and stupid teenagers, they have time for a few dozen hours of community service."
Since when was a poisoner a prankster?
"""Prankster"", more like ""Attempted Murderer"""
Caning should be a punishment in this country.
"Poisoning people isn't just a prank. Maybe this was an attempt but still.

Hopefully no person ate any or this is beyond just an attempt here.

Pesticides are not supposed to be consumed. That will screw you up, could be deadly or make you very sick at least and cause cancer.

Toxic chemical weapon.

He knew he was committing. It wad a prank to cut his brake lines. This leads to death this is always ruled attempt of murder in Illinois. Even if you claim i wasn't trying to kill them but to get them in a minor wreck.

Or if you attack someone and think your only going to hurt them. This is murder. You can't not know poisons don't harm so this is an attempt of an attack and an attack if anyone ingested any of this. And if someone died from this they would go to prison for murder here in Illinois. You can't say i only meant to hurt them a little if they died from it. Maybe just a bloody nose. They use this logic to rule these things as murder. This is the standard or they let many very bad people out of prisons. Some very bad people lied about only wanting to hurt them a little bit when they murdered.

Not a prank. They are going to prison for a very long time.

Djd anyone actually get out the door with any of this produce? 

Walmart is going to have to deep clean poison off sll surfaces.

If anyone consumed this. It isn't just introducing poison. It's a charge for poisoning someone. Introducing it doesn't mean someone got poisoned by it. Maybe they found out and didn't consume any. If they did that is a direct poisoning a person charge isn't it?

Also no reason he wasn't just playing this off as a prank. Because this was serious."
"Hurr hurr herpty doo, watch me poison the masses"
Not really a prank though huh. Douche
"> and rotisserie chickens

At least on the produce one would expect to wash it. The chickens though? They're now garbage. What an ass."
Mf like this bring down our whole race
This guy has been causing trouble for months. It's about time he got arrested.
"Unless we can legalize hitting these pranksters on the spot, it is not going to change. Like the ice cream licking girl or some other random asshat doing something crazy somewhere else"
"That's not a prank when it could kill, sicken, or injure innocent people, including children."
Do your part by not watching prank videos and downvoting bad behavior.
"Prankster?! Oh yeah, he‚Äôs quite the rascal, that one."
"I'm by that Walmart and to quote the  influencer after his arrest:
"" I've already made $10000 by this """
Fuck him and any streaming platform that encourages/finances this type of behavior
Pranks don‚Äôt result in dead people if you get away with them. Not a real prank. Not funny. Not excusable. Make an example of him and hopefully send a message to other idiot ‚Äúpranksters‚Äù.
"A prank assumes that the people being pranked laughed. If the person being pranked doesn‚Äôt laugh, then you‚Äôre just a dick"
felony's aren't pranks....
I knew someone who had to be taken to the ER and could have died because they ate an apple that had pesticide on it.
Factor II psychopathy on display; glad he's locked up
"Companies that sell pesticide imply that it is safe, but some people think that pesticides are linked to Parkinson's disease."
This is just domestic terrorism
I expected the guy who did this to be a teen...this loser is 27!
"That‚Äôs no prank, that‚Äôs terrorism."
"The most he gets is a class 6 felony? Seriously? Should get terrorism charges. If killing a specific CEO gets terrorism charges, how the fuck doesn't this?"
Prankster? Or Eco-terrorist?
"Monsanto: Hey, only WE can do that! üò°"
Prankster more like domestic terrorist
That‚Äôs an act of terrorism
"I dunno, sounds like a terrorist to me."
Just saw this video on another sub and it reminded be how this kid at camp sprayed insect repellent in this other kids cheese poof tin and then it got passed around and made a bunch of people sick.
I'm surprised that Walmart turn over the cost of damages.  Of over a certain amount he'll be hit with felony.
YES!!!!!! God this makes me feel good. FUCK that guy.  About fucking time
Pranks = felonies now?
Closer to terrorism than Luigi
I can't believe this asshat is 27. I thought it was a typo. Ugh.

jfc the prank memes aren‚Äôt lying. these fuxking losers would 100% shoot up a building and call it a prank.
"GA, lilburn...got to the market right at closing, pass by the produce and their is a guy spraying it with something...just at that moment the manager walks by and almost yells quietly ""you are not supposed to spray that while customers are in the store""...ever wonder why there are no tiny flies around the produce?"
Can we stop calling them pranksters? Because they're not. Even on their best days.
Sick prank bro enjoy your 20 livestream views and your jail cell
"Make an example of this asshole, don't over charge so it doesn't result in a conviction but charge the most possible that can be proven and don't offer a plea."
"Can‚Äôt wait to see the look on that families face when they realize I added even more pesticides on their already pesticide laden produce! 

Lol you got punked! 

Ha ha ha seriously though that‚Äôs not a prank at all, that‚Äôs just mass assault."
Not prankster.  Idiot.
"If you poison the food I buy for myself and my family, I'll prank you to an early grave"
That‚Äôs not a prank. A minimum it‚Äôs vandalism and I‚Äôm sure a real lawyer could argue it‚Äôs  something like assault.
Sounds like terrorism!
Gotta love it when bullies pretending to be pranksters are arrested.
Release every drug user from prison to make room for social media shitheads. Send these worthless fucks to prison instead.
"You spelled ""criminal dipshit"" wrong"
"Its not a prank, its digiornos."
I‚Äôve seen this guy do shit before. Thank god
That's not a prank.¬† That's attempted manslaughter.¬† Poisoning people on purpose is a felony.
is he actually gonna be punished?
"‚ÄúHaha. Its just a prank bro!‚Äù

The prank:"
I‚Äôm pretty sure a major threat to public health isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúprank‚Äù
"wtf is wrong with some people?

"Pretty sure that‚Äôs attempt to cause bodily injury among a host of other felonies. It‚Äôs not a prankster, it‚Äôs a fucking criminal."
That's poisoning food üòï people can get sick or die that should be a felony
On rotisserie chicken too. Could have killed a kid. Fuck this guy.
Sounds like an act of terrorism. Using chemical weapons
These assholes gonna kill my lazy ass trying to eat healthy.
"Damn, I was at that Walmart yesterday and saw a bunch of cops. I bet they were looking at the CTV footage. That‚Äôs not a prank, and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs arrested."
I mean.  Isn‚Äôt pesticides sprayed on produce?
"TIL attempted murder is a ‚Äúprank.‚Äù 
Free Luigi I guess - it was just a really *successful* prank, bro!?"
What the fuck!? Why the hell would anyone ever think it was fine to do that? I hope the shit bag is punished to the full extent possible.
I went through his videos that he had uploaded to Instagram. I have no idea how he made it this long without getting arrested for any of the other things he did. Shit like walking into fast food and throwing a watermelon into the fryer. Fuck this guy
"It sounds to me like deliberate poisoning of the public, or attempted poisoning of the public. It also endangers the people who are in the store and who can be exposed to aerosols either from drift through the air or through the ventilation system. Some people can be exquisitely sensitive to pesticides, and may have serious medical issues. 

This guy should be in prison"
"It's not even bullshit rage content. He's just straight going around poisoning people, regardless of the original intention. This asshole needs to have multiple books thrown at his ass."
Or we can call it using chemical weapons and hang some terrorist charges on them
"It's more than being an asshole though - consuming pesticide / bed bug spray is negligent homicide if he likely is stupid enough to think this couldn't kill anyone - otherwise if he knew, attempted murder.

He might as well have sprayed bullets at a crowd of people.

Fucker needs to be locked up for a long time."
It‚Äôs actual terrorism.
"Was he yelling ""WORLDSTAR"" too?"
"Sounds more like a terroristic act, to me."
">straight up asshole

Much, much, much worse.

https://youtu.be/2qic-KnX4tI?si=iTNJEdQ8xdknusVN"
Far from a prank. There are kids who could have eaten that produce.
That‚Äôs a domestic terrorist.
It‚Äôs called terrorism. He‚Äôs a terrorist.
"I know these kinds of jackasses have always existed but it feels like they come up more often now.

Had a trio of them in my grocery store when I was working continuously pestering one customer. I hadn't seen that but they asked me to help them find something and brought me over to him and said that I asked for his number while they were filming it. Obviously I reacted very flustered-like because I wasn't expecting it which is exactly what they wanted. But they got pale when I was about to talk to my manager about it."
I think they just got autocorrected on 'poisoner'.
That's not an asshole. That's a straight up murderer trying to kill people for likes and clicks.

"> this kind of content is what gets engagement

In his police interview he said he's making $10k/mo on his ""pranks"""
"Social media companies need to start demonetization and immediate banning of people producing content like this that promotes harmful/anti-social behavior. While I understand they don't necessarily have a legal obligation, it would be in the best interests of the mental health of their users and society at large if we didn't turn people into celebrities for trying to out dickhead one another for clicks."
"Turns out, it's a felony. Hope it was worth it."
Even spraying water on produce and making it seem like something nefarious is pretty fucking terrible. Actually poisoning food is just crazy evil.
"I looked that up. A class 6 felony is the least severe kind of felony in Arizona and is the only class of felony that can be converted to a misdemeanor by the prosecutor. It can net you up to five years in prison, and potentially a fine.¬†


I guess five years is reasonable.¬† I hope the prosecutor doesn't turn it into a misdemeanor though."
"He should be charged with ""Tampering with Consumer Products"" also"
"In some states, causing mistrust of the safety of agriculture is its own crime. 

The grocery store chain and all produce growers  have solid civil cases against him, too."
They should definitely give him terrorism charges for applying a dangerous chemical agent to food products‚Ä¶
Should be charged with a foot up their ass
He would have been straight up executed by police firing squad if one of those poisoned fruits had touched the hands of a CEO.

"Posting crimes is a win/win for platforms, if there's video of their content creators getting lit up by the cops that's just more engaging content. There's no floor."
Step 3: profit
"You do realize how much content is uploaded every minute, right?  
  
Unless you have banned words in your description, the only way these companies can know of illegal content is if others report it."
Why do social media companies allow this?  Because they make bank. It‚Äôs all about the Benjamins
"Just for reference 500 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute. Unless something gets noticed by an algorithm which in this case I‚Äôm not sure what would be flagged, it‚Äôll stay until it gets reported and reviewed by a human."

Moderating content on websites and apps isn‚Äôt easy peasy. An employee would have to be aware of the content at all in order to ban it. There are algorithms in place to help but who is even thinking of this type of ‚Äúprank‚Äù to put it into the algorithm? Too many videos per employee for perfect moderation.
It was up for eight minutes. Someone diligently grabbed it and shared it with authorities before it was removed.
Engagement gets money. Rage bait gets engagement. Can't ban the money makers.

So for example if WalMart spends more than $10,000 throwing out all the produce he tainted, cleaning the poison from the store, and restocking (including labor for the employees doing that), then it becomes a class 3 felony instead of a class 1 misdemeanor.  So no need to charge him for each individual thing.


Agreed that he should get a class 6 felony ""introducing poison"" and misdemeanor ""endangerment"" charge for *each* item he sprayed with poison (considering that if those items had all been bought by different people, you'd be looking at that many potential victims)."

There are quite a few people like this"
"That's a person about doing bad stuff because he thinks it's fun that cannot have fun a normal harmless way.

Some people get it in their heads the only thing is fun is bad or illegal to them and they can't have fun doing normal things like normal people.

So they stay criminals and do just about every crime because it's cool to them. Same people who will do all the hard drugs and attack other physically because they are just having fun doing this. Such as beating someone up or damaging their property.

They think it's fun because it's cool or they think it's cool to their peers that he is a bad ass that will go out and do these bad things and this makes him tougher. Was it cool when you murdered someone because you thought throwing bricks over an overpass at cars was fun and that they couldn't prove it and lack any and all empathy?

That part of you that should think about how you would feel if that happened to you where you put yourself in someone elses shoes. Not just how they would physically feel but how they would view this too. What they would think about it.

A psychopath that hasn't learn empathy because they don't have any but they have lots of friends. They also mimic emotions and play people apart to get their way among things.

Remember psychopaths have more friends and not less friends."

"Product tampering is a federal crime in the United States, and is governed by Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 1365 of the Federal Anti-Tampering Act.    
Tampering includes tampering with the product itself, its container, or its label, as well as tainting the product, making false claims, or threatening to tamper with it.     
Penalties for tampering can include up to 20 years in prison, fines, and life imprisonment if someone dies as a result."
Yeah I was going to say: I honestly think the charges are too light. I'm being serious.
Terrorism on top of that.

Criminal Damage (Class 1 Misdemeanor).
Endangerment (Class 1 Misdemeanor).
Theft (Class 1 Misdemeanor)."
"Had someone died, it wouldn‚Äôt actually matter if he knew or not in this case..

Committing a felony (like introducing poison) that results in a death bumps the charge up to 1st degree murder. The death doesn‚Äôt have to be premeditated or intentional.

So his ‚Äòprank‚Äô could have resulted in him receiving the death penalty."
Only if a rich person buys the produce though.
"Terrorism means to instill fear to the government or public with an agenda.   This is just some idiot doing stuff which he probably doesn't have the thought process to realize some of the stuff could injure someone.  Sounds like he's just doing it for reactions for views, not to spread fear."

"Here's a theory for you, the evolutionary step that made homo sapiens win out in evolution was at some point developing the ability to process and contemplate fiction.  You can't have religion, monetary systems, governments, etc.. without this ability.  No Monkey will give you its banana on the promise of infinite bananas in a monkey afterlife.  

So for all the advantages this may have given us in getting to where we are right about now.  It's starting to look like this very same ability is what is going to ultimately destroy us.  As for various reasons, usually fiction related, we now live in a period where the object truth of something is often ignored.  

For example if we were an advanced intelligent species but couldn't process fiction we'd be fixing climate change."
"Maybe it's the universe's way of putting natural selection back into play in a world where we can artificially keep the frail, sick, and less capable alive and reproducing."

"Hey now, dont knock cat pictures. They're the best part of the internet. Idiot conspiracy assholes can fuck right off though. Into the sun ideally."

Honestly this one those instances where I hope Walmart sues the fuck out him
Class 6 felony. The lowest possible felony. This is bullshit.
I'm starting to think that people who commit crimes for social media fame (which leads to money) should have restrictions on them using it in the future.
Agreed. He literally tried poisoning people. That should not be a misdemeanor.
"Looked into this dude.

He has a LOT of videos of himself doing LOTS of stuff.

If he doesn't catch additional charges I will be absolutely shocked."
They may not be 100% done adding up all the charges.  Not uncommon for new ones to come in later.
"I can‚Äôt imagine throwing away 5 years of your life for less than nothing, people are fascinating."

"Yup. Social media thrives on engagement, and controversy fuels clicks like nothing else. Platforms aren‚Äôt incentivized to enforce a moral ‚Äúfloor‚Äù because outrage, sensationalism, and even shock content keep people scrolling. If someone posts evidence of their own crimes or gets into a violent encounter, it‚Äôs just another viral moment to monetize.

The algorithms don‚Äôt care about ethics; they care about retention. The more extreme the content, the more people watch, comment, and share, regardless of the consequences for society. It‚Äôs a grim reflection of how these platforms prioritize profit over accountability, feeding into a vicious cycle of exploitation and sensationalism."
What step 2?
I reported a video of a guy showing how to steal from convenience stores. Report came back that the content is allowed.
Intent to harm others is not redeemable. We might make an exception for younger children but thats should be it.

The argument being made is that if one of the platforms that celebrates and encourages this kind of behavior wasn‚Äôt there or was much more heavily regulated, then the behavior might be less prevalent. I think there are still some problems with this argument, but it is at least somewhat reasonable."
A future CEO may have been though.
It still bothers me they never caught that culprit. Horrifying. Poisoning anyone is diabolical work - poisoning strangers to cover it up is exponentially more sinister.

"> The human mind was not evolutionarily prepared to be constantly immersed in this much bad information

If you are going to bring evolution into it, then preparedness would depend upon some sort of fitness test imposed by the ""immersion in bad information.""

People talk about evolution as if it is something that happens to us before we encounter our limitations. That is backward.

In Guy Ritchie's movie *Snatch*, Tommy snatches the milk from Turkish and tells him, ""the human body isn't evolved to digest milk"" - which may or may not be true, depending upon the individual. But what Tommy doesn't seem to grasp, is that if we (collectively) don't drink milk, we (or rather, our descendants) can't ever gain that evolutionary trait.

So what we need to do is continue to ""immerse ourselves in bad information"", and hope that traits which allow us to handle misinformation provide some sort of reproductive or survival advantage."

If this moron gets off with less it will be a shock, because Walmart has an army of lawyers on retainer."

5.6 years is for third and subsequent convictions. First conviction is only 1.5 to 3 years.

I agree.  imo social media like TikTok and Facebook can be addictive and can negatively impact developing minds.  It should be age restricted and regulated to prevent some of the addicting effects.
"I'm guessing that by the time they were made aware of this, customers had already purchased some of the sprayed items. If so, it goes from ""trying"" to poison people to actually poisoning them."

If an idiot like this has multiple videos of him harassing people in public, it acts as a turbocharger for the dolt's unacceptable behavior. At any rate, screw this moron to the wall and make an example out of him.

For me, thinking about a monetary system helps make the point.  So obviously without some kind of monetary system pure trade quickly runs into problems like the car dealer isn't going to want the farmer's 300,000 apples for the car.  So we need some medium of trade, yet we all need to agree that this rock or hunk of metal represents something that it really does not.  Since the actual item is just that, a hunk of metal.

"Depends. Insurance CEOs, probably. Its hard to be profitable in insurance if you dont intend to do harm.

But most CEOs arent out there with the intent to actually hurt people. For the most part it does them no good to actually hurt their customers. Insurance is a special case because A) it was required by law and thus B) they can raise the prices as much as they want and everyone still has to pay. In fact, its better for insurance if medical costs go up and more people die. It makes their service even more indispensable.

I do agree, we need to lock up more CEOs, politicians, and many of the so called ""leaders"" (they really arent) of the world. I think we all acknowledge this.

Billionaires as a class though? I dont think money makes you inherently vile. Ive learned over the years, money just amplifies who you are but doesnt change you. It just removes social inhibitions and reveals your true nature. So a ar$ehole becomes an even bigger ar$ehole. But a good person also continues being so and to higher degree but you probably never hear about them. So im not sold on going after people because of wealth specifically. Its what they do with it same as anyone else. I think normal people are just as vile as rich but many are held back because they need to play nice."
"> He also turned himself in to the police, so he knows he fucked up and knows what he did was wrong.


I doubt he's having some moral epiphany by turning himself in - it's self serving.  He knows if the police have to come looking for him, it will make things worse (additional charges, potential for violence, less likely to be offered leniency in sentencing, etc).  He's looking out for #1, not ""realizing that he did something wrong.""

"You can surrender any pet to the MSPCA. 

This guy sounds like an animal."
A serial killer in the making. I didn't know you could go to prison for killing your animal.
Crazy but I guess the dog didn‚Äôt feel it. :/
So his parents knew the situation. They didn't offer to take the dog in. You can surrender an animal. It should be a red flag for vets when someone comes to euthanize a healthy animal. This guy was obviously sick and this could have been prevented. Nobody intervened. What he did is unexceptionable but there were plenty of opportunities to step in.
We don't deserve dogs as it is and shit like this is why
The other prisoners will react well to this sentence. /s

His reasoning makes zero sense to me.

"Yeah this dude just sounds like a fucking prick though. As someone that's struggled with addiction, I've never thought about solving any of my problems like this dude. 

The biggest danger was, me, to myself. 

If he was going to actually try and adopt the dog out, he would have done it, instead of poisoning and stabbing a poor animal like that

That's cool to hear about the foster dog guy though! He sounds fucking awesome üòé"
"He wanted to kill the dog when it was inconvenient, not give it to someone else. Narcissistic behavior."
"> Authorities said Paluzzi had tried to have Brutus euthanized by a veterinarian, but the animal care center refused because the dog was healthy.

It sounds like he went straight into the mindset that if Brutus couldn't stay with him, he had to die. I know that no animal shelter or rescue group would have said no to taking the dog in, especially in good health. Assuming he survives in prison, this will haunt him more than what he witnesses while serving time simply because he did it with how own hands."
Someone using there useful skill for good‚Ä¶ how many of you aren‚Äôt?
"Agree. 

Murdering an innocent dog is absolutely disgusting. I can‚Äôt even comprehend such an act. And I don‚Äôt care if he is a drug addict who needed rehab, he still murdered a living creature. Put this sociopath in a prison cell for the rest of his life."
"No argument there. But I don't think it's much more evil than someone who takes their dog to the vet to be put down just because they are moving somewhere the dog isn't welcome.

Happens constantly and seems to carry no penalty at all. It's sick."
Or more animals...
I just watched Don‚Äôt Fuck with Cats (I‚Äôm VERY late to the party) and yes. He‚Äôll graduate to humans if he isn‚Äôt stopped.
Did you not read the article?
If you think people that are locked up don‚Äôt stab other people‚Ä¶.oh boy‚Ä¶.
"(Ex) vet assistant here, some people do try to get their pets euthanized just because they don‚Äôt want them anymore."
"*Paluzzi‚Äôs parents¬†told NBC10 Boston¬†after his arrest that he loved Brutus and tried to give the animal up because he was trying to go into rehab.*

Giving the dog a Xanax wouldn't help. He wouldn't be around, period."
I‚Äôm a licensed vet tech in the US.  We do not normally euthanize healthy animals unless they are dangerous or cannot be safely re- homed for multiple reasons. There are a lot of professional ethics and standards we follow. Even against our bosses occasionally. I once refused to euthanize a healthy cat with manageable insulin dependent diabetes that a senior staff member- a veterinarian -asked me to do.
"I can see his reasoning, but I'm almost afraid to explain it here because everybody seems completely blinded by the fact it was a dog and decided the guy was a psychopath who had a hard on while killing the dog.  

If the guy really loved the dog, I can see him only being able to consider giving it away to someone he thought would care for and love the dog like he did.  

Once that was not a viable route, I can see him thinking that a shelter would be hell for the dog. That the dog would be afraid and sad at the shelter, fearing people at the shelter would not care for the dog properly, that the dog would miss him immensenly, and the guy anticipating his own mental anguish while he's in rehab, thinking about how his dog is suffering. So I can understand him thinking putting the dog down was the only viable option to end that particular chain of suffering.  

The guy was an addict, his emotions were anything but normal and under control. When you're in a mentally taxing situation, you get emotional tunnel vision, you become absolutely certain of the worst possible outcomes and blind to bright sides and hope.  

Then, after he could not get someone to put the dog down humanely, and in his fucked up mental state, yeah, I can see him deciding all he can do is do it himself. I don't think this was psychopathic lack of emotion, I think it was an overload of emotion and despair.  

We can see it rationally, we can see it from the perspective that the dog will evidently be much better at a shelter, even if it's one of those no-kill shelters which discreetly move unwanted animals to a kill shelter after a little while. But I don't think that he was able to see that. There's also a fucked up sense of responsibility that adds to a mess like this. And, depending on how active this guy was on pets forums, he could have internalized the idea that it's monstrous to surrender your dog, so shame may have played another huge rol in all of this. And if the guy was going to rehab, you better believe shame was a massive weight on him already.  

I think it's sad all around and if the guy is a monster, he's the pathetic kind, not the evil sort."
Because he's a psycho not really that hard
"The guy tried to have the dog re-homed. Couldn't. Tried to have him euthanized properly. Was rejected. So he did the only thing he knew to do and tried to do it himself.

The biggest tragedy in this case is that some poor addict who was just trying to go to rehab now has to spend SEVEN YEARS in prison over this."
Right there with you.
You should meet more massholes then.

"We can all acknowledge that someone is sick. There were plenty of red flags and his parents or the vet he allegedly brought the dog to could've stepped in. This was preventable.

There is indeed a place reserved for these people."
For some reason everyone sympathizes with the POS
That's called being in favour of the death penalty.
"(Doesn't like death penalty.)

(Kill that guy)

Totally coherent."
"He needs mental health counselling and drug rehab, not the death penalty if the quotes in the article are true."
Did you read the article?
it can be pretty difficult/impossible to find a shelter that will take owner surrenders
"Did you read the article?

Rhetorical question. I know you didn't, it's obvious."
"Yeah, why bother with appeals process or reducing the risks of executing innocent people. If they're accused of killing a dog, instant death."
"I mean, he was a drug addict. He probably literally wasn't thinking straight.

Sucks that it ended this way, with a dead dog and a man in prison. They both just needed help."
That would be too quick
"I know people love to use the most extreme language possible, but it is literally impossible to murder a dog"
"He tried to get his parents to adopt the dog, but they said they couldn't take care of it.

Also, he tried euthanizing it at the vet, but they wouldn't do it because the dog was healthy.

One big question is:  why did he choose death for the dog, rather than just let it wander?  Perhaps he thought there'd be too little of a chance to make it into a good family."
Their* skills. I am using my basic understanding of a second language to correct you now. What are you doing for the good of the world?
Or maybe just do the exact same thing to him.
Agreed. I hope he gets what he deserves
Seriously. Anyone who murders an animal other than for food should be in prison for life.
"Meanwhile you probably drink milk, eat eggs, consume chicken or cow meat, both the byproducts of industrial animal farming that are full of animal rights abuses. You ought to question why it‚Äôs illegal to kill a dog, but not a cow or a chicken if it‚Äôs for industrial profit‚Ä¶ 

And if animals can never give consent, then they don‚Äôt consent to be forced into pregnancy either. That also applies to dog breeders, and industrial farming practices of artificial insemination. 

Apply your disgust equitably amongst society, instead of just 1 man."
They already refused to do that for him in this case.
"The pets industry as a whole is responsible for incredible amounts of animal suffering. People love pets, but they don't love them enough to stop keeping them. It's sick."
Or even the title?
He couldn‚Äôt find someone to take his dog so he could go to rehab so he went to the vet and asked for them to put the dog down and they said no and that the dog was perfectly healthy and instead of going to a shelter and surrendering the dog the piece of shit junkie went home and tried to over dose his dog and when it didn‚Äôt work he stabbed it to death. He deserves the same death. Absolute scumbag piece of shit.
Stabbing a dog to death is the actions of a human being void of any emotions or reason. He is a sociopath. Stop trying to be woke
"I've seen plenty of stories on here and other places about people taking their exs dog to be put down even though it's perfectly healthy. I can't imagine why or how someone could even think of that. I can understand giving a suffering and dying animal something to help them humanly, but this is fucked up."
My parents did that a few times. They would lie to the vet that it had aggression problems and that it was attacking people and the vet would just put it down. These were totally innocent dogs who never hurt anyone. I feel no love for my parents.
"My mom did a year in that job. She was a softie (still is lol) for animals so we ended up with a lot of interesting critters from that time. She‚Äôs often mentioned that people like that who wanted to euthanize healthy or nearly healthy animals, they just wouldn‚Äôt kill the animals and they‚Äôd find them homes. I know that‚Äôs not always possible."
"Thats better for the dog. I have 2 dogs and wouldnt do this, but were else are the dogs going to ends up?"
I can only imagine how expensive cat insulin is. Sometimes people don't have good choices when it comes to difficult situations like that.
"I‚Äôm a vet and you‚Äôd be surprised how frequently the thinking you‚Äôve described is exactly the case. Shelters and fosters often aren‚Äôt seen as QoL locations for many pet owners and perceive euthanasia as a better alternative. You‚Äôll have them saying that they‚Äôd need to personally find potential adopters of their pet to trust they‚Äôre worthy of taking them in and then in the same breath say they basically can‚Äôt be bothered to look. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt love and adore their pets, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôve already convinced themselves that whatever reason is causing them to need to get rid of them is too difficult to manage and if that‚Äôs the case, the problem of finding an adopter is even harder. 

To be very clear I don‚Äôt agree with this line of thinking - in the way I view animals and pets, I think it‚Äôs exceptionally selfish, lazy, stupid, etc. But I do understand it. When looking at this story, I don‚Äôt see an owner who hated his dog, I see an owner who couldn‚Äôt emotionally regulate and euthanized his dog on his own. Pathetic, sure, but I‚Äôm not even sure it makes him a monster. 

A lot of Reddit tough guys in this thread pretending like they‚Äôd ‚Äúgive him the dickens‚Äù, but fail to acknowledge the tragic humanity that exists in the story. I‚Äôd do anything for my pets, but I also value human life - the man deserves punishment no doubt  but also maybe the opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption?"
I agree. Things are very black and white for most people but life isn‚Äôt like that.
"He may not have been able to surrender the dog to a shelter‚Ä¶ most of them make you pay, or refuse owner surrenders, or book you an appointment that‚Äôs weeks away."

"You don't like killing. But your village is under attack by a crazed, rabid tiger. If you have the chance, would you kill the tiger?

Or a more mundane situation: You don't like literal shit. But your only car keys fell into the john in a public toilet after you have just pooped and there's no one and nothing around to help you get it without using your hand. What would you do?

This is what humans *are*. We have the sapience and logic to do what we normally would not like to do, in extreme situations."
"Nah, counseling goes out the window when you start killing for convenience."
Yeah but isn‚Äôt it pointless and a waste of resources to rehabilitate someone and thrust them back into a society that won‚Äôt want him in ~6 years?

"There is a high likelihood of a short lifespan and awful death for a dog abandoned to the streets. He likely thought this was a better answer than that, and as terrible as his decision was, it likely was a better decision than that. 

A better option would be adopting it out or surrendering it to animal control or a shelter if he could find one to take it in. 

Please never suggest abandoning a dog to the streets.  The only thing abandoning a dog to the streets does for the person is let them not know just how horrific their death was."
"Only asking your parents to adopt the dog is not nearly enough. I‚Äôm curious if he tried posting online? Can‚Äôt believe his next idea was to get the dog euthanized, and then to kill it himself.   So fucked."
I mean it definitely is probably better than killing it but there are a variety of reasons that people should not just release dogs lol. Also if it had been picked up at that point there‚Äôs a high chance of it being euthanized by the powers that be. I‚Äôm in no way defending killing the dog‚Äîit‚Äôs just that this story still doesn‚Äôt get a happy ending even if he just released it into America
"He is selfish that‚Äôs why. 
The man is an addict and it‚Äôs very common for addicts to have a very strong selfish victim mentality. Instead of being a responsible adult and doing the difficult task of finding a decent home for this dog they chose to murder ???
They acted like they had no other options. 
I‚Äôm sure when they went to the vet to euthanize their healthy dog that the vets could have provided them information/ suggestions for rehoming."
Let it wander? What if the stray dog had killed a toddler?
He did provide an example of how not to speak.
"I walk around my neighborhood and pick up trash, meditate and made a commitment to non violence."
"It's funny to me that ""yummy food"" somehow justifies something that should have you put in prison for life otherwise. Why?

I understand it in situations where life is at stake, but in most of the western world, the benefit of killing an animal for meat or other products is only better taste pleasure. If you think killing animals for any other kind of pleasure is enough to be put in jail for life, why is the taste of your food suddenly such an important goal it completely justifies it?

Edit: I got got."
That would put most people who work at animal shelters in prison. There are many kill after certain time shelters in the USA. That's a very broad statement you are making there. Would also put a bunch of veterinarians in prison too.¬†¬†
"Yeah, this is not cognitive dissonance, it's hypocrisy. There is a difference. 

For that matter, it's okay for an Israeli to kill a Palestinian or a Saudi to kill a Houthi or a Ukranian to kill a Russian and make a video of it and put it on social media but God forbid some kid takes a pop at a US healthcare CEO --that's murder! (clutches pearls) 

I think people who are all hung up on killing just don't spend enough time in the garden. Anybody who works with a compost pile and weeds their garden realizes that it's an endless stream of killing. Life and death are two sides of the same coin.  

Whenever I read about some nut being executed for committing a horrific muder and then find that they were ""just curious about what it was like to take a life"" I can't help but think --man, it's so obvious these people don't do any gardening. Gardening and farming is like non-stop killing. That's how the real world is. Killing is all around us and a normal part of being alive. 

This guy is a victim of the War on Drugs that created the black market making him financially dependent on his parents creating guilt that he took out on his dog. Who is really to blame in this? The self-righteous pricks who created this system with their holier than thou shaming of drug usage should take a look in the mirror when they rage about the horror of this ""murder""."
"I've known several vets over the years, and they all say they spend a LOT of their time putting down dogs. Most of the time it's for a good reason, but at least once a week they will be putting down a dog for no good reason other than the owner can't be bothered making more of an effort.

They tell me it is heartbreaking and slowly poisons you from the inside out."
People's love for pets is conditional though and conditions often change.
"Imma be real that sounds like a resource problem, if he tried to give it up and couldn't find a way and also went to a vet to euthanize properly, then clearly he wasn't wanting to kill the dog just to kill the dog. It's tragic, it sounds like a mentally ill guy confronting not being able to care for his dog in an unhealthy way."
"There's nothing woke about making excuses for this type of behavior. He definitely is a sociopath, but that has nothing to do with racism. Stop regurgitating political nonsense without knowing what it means."
"The taking of another life is literally against society. 

That‚Äôs base sociopath."
I am 100% for euthanasia when an animal is really suffering or dying or aggressive to the point where it‚Äôs unable to be trained and has attacked or killed multiple people; it‚Äôs the humane thing to do. But to just kill a living being because you don‚Äôt want it anymore? That‚Äôs insanely cruel.
That‚Äôs awful.
Your parents are aggressive and should be euthanized before they cause me any physical harm.
"A shelter? At least ATTEMPT to re-home them or give them to someone that will. Some literally just want the pets to die because they won‚Äôt be the owner anymore. Now we could go into a whole discussion about how inhumane some shelters are (used to work at one) and how some pets stay there for years until they die, but it‚Äôs pretty jarring to just immediately think ‚Äúoh yeah, let‚Äôs just kill the dog/cat/etc.‚Äù"
"Beautifully written. It's like the saying goes: I see humans, but no humanity. Too many are too quick to judge.¬†"
"Yeah, a shelter I volunteered at in a very poor city charged $100 for dog surrenders. Which is why people would dump them in the desert, tie them to random poles in town, etc."
"In my city all shelters are completely full, they are constantly turning people away so now we have a huge problem of people dumping pets‚Ä¶ who then get hit by cars or injured in other ways that then end up in the same shelter that most likely refused them in the first place now asking for fundraisers to help pay for their medical care.

It‚Äôs a really fucking shitty situation right now."
"Ok, I didn't know that. It makes it worse. From other comments I assumed just basically just dropping by and saying you can not longer care for the dog."
"No. It was probably wrong of me to mention that because all I have I other people mentioning it, I haven't looked into it myself. Also that some no-kill shelters only take young, healthy and ""adoptable"" pets. But again, only other people's comments about it. Sorry."
"A dude killing a dog is not an ""extreme situation"" when your baseline situation for not liking the death penalty usually involves the killing of a person.

Dogs are not more important than people."
Why would society not want him if he is rehabilitated?
"Animal shelters are not much better. They get shoved into a tiny cage so small they sometimes cannot even turn around pretty much 24/7.

I have a lot of sympathy for this guy. It was clearly an attempt at DIY euthanasia, not animal cruelty. He had no good options."
I don't feel like mediation and committing to non violence really counts. You're not really doing anything for anyone. Try to be less condescending so you don't negate any of the good you do picking up trash.
"Yup, it's extreme hypocrisy to want this harsh a punishment for something *except* if you're doing it because you like the taste. Then it's fine to pay for it multiple times a day. 

What if this person had just eaten the dog afterwards? Then we're all good with it I guess?"
"We can make other reasonable exceptions like that. I just want to make sure we're allowed to murder animals for food. People who murder them for reasons like in this post should get the harshest sentence possible other than capital punishment, but if they're murdered because we like their taste there should be zero consequence."
"It should be a heavily regulated industry, with barriers to entry and a lengthy vetting process. But we don't even value the lives of other humans so it's no real shock that we are so needlessly cruel to non-human species."
"He decided unilaterally that the dog must die, no matter what, so yes he is a POS."
He stabbed the dog to death with a Fucking bbq fork . You clearly don‚Äôt know the story because that‚Äôs why he got jail time for this .
He never took the dog to a shelter any shelter would have taken the dog and rehomed him.
Well the point is that the vet couldn‚Äôt euthanize properly because they had no medical reason to. The shelter is the resource he needs and him not seeking it out doesn‚Äôt mean those resources are lacking.¬†
Don't say that too loud in a McDonald's
">But to just kill a living being because you don‚Äôt want it anymore?

No, to hurt their ex, that's why they are trying."
People do it to livestock animals all the time without batting an eye
It‚Äôs gotta kill multiple people before it should be put down?
It isnt the easy decision to make. Dogs know abandonment and can suffer mentally on top of whatever physical pain they might also endure.
"I'm not even gonna argue about you basing your argument with a ""usually"", but if you feel this way then this is where we have to agree to disagree, then. There's a fundamental difference in mindset here.

To me killing a pet dog outside of self defence and actual mercy euthanasia is arguably more evil than killing a random person - the dog trusts its human absolutely. Killing it thus is a vile, vile act. 

To move to your other point from here, I never said dogs are more important than people, as you can read yourself in my previous comment. However a person capable the vile act of killing a trusting pet dog is certainly easily capable of killing other people as well, making him/her a threat worthy of the death penalty."
"That‚Äôs my point, but nuance is lost on these idiots."
"Lmao, reasonable exceptions. So you think the industry practice of abusing animals is okay because it feeds capitalism and profits, and ‚Äúconsumption.‚Äù But somehow only this news disgusts you? 

You are either against all abuse, or none. There is no I get to pick and choose what counts as abuse or not."
"I don't want to tell you how many healthy dogs are euthanized per day, decided upon unilaterally."
No one said he shouldn't go to jail just saying that it sounds like he tried to give it up first and that didn't work.
That's disturbing. Was meth involved?
">""It sounds like he intended on giving the dog away, trying to give it to a shelter. He also apparently had tried to get it euthanized, but nobody would euthanize it because it was healthy. So, for one reason or another, he wanted to get rid of the dog and apparently decided the best way to do that was to kill it,"" explained Kingston Police Det. Lt. Michael Skowyra.

"Yeah, it's odd he could access a vet and either couldn't or wouldn't access a shelter."
"Yeah, I don't know how he could go to a vet but couldn't go to a shelter."
"Some people do it for other reasons, like just not wanting to re-home the pet."
"Yes, I also believe that is wrong. I wanted to become a large animal veterinarian for a long time until I realized farm animals are just seen as capital and most (not all) farmers will choose to do whatever is cheapest. Unfortunately most farmers make very little money (are usually in large amounts of debt) and are just forced to do whatever is the most economically viable option, which most of the time is euthanasia.

We‚Äôve created a system in which profit is seen as more important than empathy or humanity. The unfortunate reality is that pigs, cows, and chickens will always be seen as lesser animals in western societies. Every animal should be treated with respect and dignity, even ‚Äúfood‚Äù animals that will eventually be slaughtered. If we are to eat them, we should at the very least give them a good and abuse-free life. Instead, we grind up live chicks and keep pigs and cows and chickens in extremely confined spaces and cull the entire population whenever there‚Äôs a disease outbreak."
Meant multiple for attacks; of course if it kills a person it should be put down immediately. Use your brain.
That‚Äôs a piss-poor excuse.
"Dogs are also smart and adaptable, and are capable of adjusting to life changes. My first rescue was a 9 year old German shepherd with bad arthritis. His previous owner had him since he was a puppy, but they'd moved to an apartment with lots of stairs and unfortunately he could not get up them. She asked us to adopt him because she knew us personally, and knew that he got along great with our dog. She also knew that we had a single story home, so he wouldn't have to deal with any stairs. After we adopted him he settled in surprisingly quickly. It was as if he'd lived with us for years. He quickly learned the daily routine, picked his favorite dog bed, chose his favorite dog toys, played with our other dog, started watching TV with my dad (they'd both fall asleep watching TV together, lol), etc. It was as if he'd always lived with us. He just settled in right away, easily adjusted to the big change, and quickly became part of the family."
I mean so can you‚Äîyou volunteering for the same treatment?
"If someone ‚Äúbeing capable‚Äù is enough in your opinion to prosecute, you‚Äôre not just in favor of the death penalty, but also of a ‚Äúthought police‚Äù. Prosecuting someone  based on a crime that MIGHT happen is insane.

The other possible explanation is that content is so sanitized in Reddit and social media that there‚Äôs no actual meaning behind anything said"
"This is the point I'm making here ;)

People are outraged because someone ""murdered"" an animal and want them to have one of the harshest penalties we give even for the worst crimes against humans.

*But* if someone kills an innocent animal because it tastes good, there should be zero consequences.

I don't think those are consistent positions."
The alternative was to set it loose and maybe suffer?  It shouldn't be hard to turn over an animal.
"Shelters and rescues in many areas are incredibly full. Not that this is literally in any way shape or form an excuse for what the disgusting piece of shit did but I definitely see how someone might turn to a vet if no shelters are taking owner surrenders.


That being said, if you are truly desperate and the dog is suitable for rehoming, you call every shelter in a reasonably drivable distance. If the dog doesn't have good chances of getting rehomed due to behavior issues or aggression, then you find a vet who will do a humane euthanasia's for behavioral reasons. We sadly had to euthanize one of the dogs we found because he began having extreme aggression issues towards other dogs and strangers and every shelter and rescue told us they either flat out wouldn't accept him or if they did, he'd be the first on the euthanasia list. We decided it was better for him to have his remaining time with us rather than spend his last days in a scary kennel feeling abandoned only to be euthanized alone.  A terrible situation all around but i cannot imagine being so cruel to any dog."
They are just as bad as everyone else.
"Sure, I'm talking about the thread we're in though 

>I've seen plenty of stories on here and other places about people taking their exs dog to be put down even though it's perfectly healthy"
"‚ÄúThe whole world will learn of our peaceful ways‚Ä¶ by FORCE‚Äù energy from that guy. 

Justifying killing an animal to save it the mental anguish of being rehomed is peak narcissist.

The assumption that the dog would prefer to cease living instead of being alive in a world without their original human is so beyond self-centered lol"
"It shouldn't be, but it can. Lots of local shelters in eastern mass are full to capacity and would likely euthanize either way."

> After stories about her alleged overtime abuse came out, Maddrey offered to speak to the commissioner on her behalf but first demanded that she kiss his penis, according to the complaint.

It's crazy that he unironically used the phrase ""kiss my penis"" in such a manipulative and malicious way.

Really speaks to how much integrity matters to getting high up in the NYPD (read: not much)."
Eric Adams must have been a fabulous leader.
It's endlessly frustrating that so many of the people who are in powerful positions are some of the *last* people that should ever be in powerful positions.
"Ya, my warden would tell victims that they misunderstood a situation and would either talk them down or transfer them to protect his buddies."
What‚Äôs the deal with police force hiring? Is it a requirement to be a smoldering garbage pile of a human being to join or something?
So easy bout to retire with big money? Instead of jail time and fines. Fuck the police.

He looks like a Tyson's Punch-Out character

"US police and corruption. Let's not pretend it is just the NYPD it is all cops everywhere in the USA.

Never ever trust a cop in the USA (or anywhere to be fair). They are never on your side and they are all out to get you. Why would anyone call the cops in the USA unless they are trying to get a black person killed? Someone you know having a mental health crisis? Don't call the cops they will shoot the person. Someone breaking in to your house? Good chance the cops shoot you or your family. Neighbour needs checking on for some reason? Yeah just don't.

US cops are a blunt instrument and that instrument is a hammer meant for killing."

Since Mayor McCop took over, yes.  He is the fucking WORST, and for NYC that's really saying something."
They are all dirty. There are no good cops.
The powers that be allow the cops a little corruption so long as they will be the boot on the necks of any who fight for change.
Since when has Eric Addams ever been tough on police?
"Reality is infinite shades of gray. It breaks pretty quickly when you try to make it black and white. I don't trust them either, but to see them clearly you can't just pretend they *all* behave as their worst do. It is that kind of hyperbolic black and white lens that enables extremism. False dichotomy is one of the main tools they use to control us. *And* fuck the police."
"I dunno, my next door neighbor tried to murder his wife and baby on meth. He was shot by SWAT.

I hate cops as much as the next one but let's not pretend that the kind of monsters we accuse cops of being aren't among the general populace too.

That‚Äôs some tinfoil hat thinking
But it‚Äôs not just a NYC thing
"As long as the ""good cops"" do nothing about the bad ones there are no good cops. Also even the good cops are not on your side. They will try to catch you out on things you say. Don't talk to cops, don't answer questions,  don't try to clear up a misunderstanding."
"Nope, all good cops who are not actively activists are complicit in the system as their colleagues brutalize the cities they patrol. 85% of cops voted for Trump.

Until I see cops fighting against qualified immunity, fighting against taxpayers being liable for police brutality settlements (rather than cops themselves), I am very, very comfortable saying they are all conspirators of a disgusting, decrepit system. We should be much, much more extreme."

This is the twisted mess up world cops live in. Only other cops are on their side and the rest of us are out to get them.

"> Nationwide clearance rates for both violent and property crime are at their lowest levels since at least 1993, the FBI data shows.

> Police cleared a little over a third (36.7%) of the violent crimes that came to their attention in 2022, down from nearly half (48.1%) as recently as 2013. During the same period, there were decreases for each of the four types of violent crime the FBI tracks:

>> * Police cleared 52.3% of reported murders and nonnegligent homicides in 2022, down from 64.1% in 2013.
>> * They cleared 41.4% of aggravated assaults, down from 57.7%.
>> * They cleared 26.1% of rapes, down from 40.6%.
>> * They cleared 23.2% of robberies, down from 29.4%.

"My sister choked in the 5th grade and her friend used the Heimlich maneuver to save her. Meanwhile the teacher went running out of the classroom in a panic. 

I‚Äôm very glad my sister was okay. Now to this day we tease her about the tv interview they did. And the fact that she choked on a piece of sausage."
"I did the Heimlich on a small child who was choking and it sent me from 20 year old guy not doing anything with his life to wanting to be an EMT. Which, in turn, led to wanting paramedic training, to joining the military to be a medic to ultimately going BACK to college after originally flunking out at 18. This time getting straight A‚Äôs while taking 26-30 hours a semester. Got into my first-choice medical school and have been a critical care doctor for quite a few years now. 

Thanks for choking on that piece of candy, kid."
"He remained calm and applied his knowledge to help his classmate, and that is impressive. Even adults tend to panic in emergency situations. This kid is a hero."
"Doesn't have to do with this story specifically, but my favorite thing regarding this will always be that right before he died, Henry Heimlich actually ended up using his own maneuver to save a woman. Dude was 96."
"That is the sharpest dressed, smartest looking 8 year old I have ever seen."
"Reminds me of when I was like 13 or 14 eating lunch after church. My dad noticed a lady who looked like she was choking so he told me. I was in Scouts at the time so I knew basic first aid. Went up and asked if she was choking. When she couldn't give me a response I performed the heimlich on her and three or four abdominal thrusts a piece of steak came flying out of her mouth. I asked if she was okay, had her drink some water then went back to my meal. No one knew besides me, my dad, and the elderly couple I helped out. The husband came to my table afterwards and gave me $20 as a thank you for saving his wife's life lol"
"The current guidance is to start with back blows and then alternate between abdominal thrusts and back blows:

https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-choking/basics/art-20056637#:~:text=Strike%20five%20separate%20times%20between,until%20the%20blockage%20is%20dislodged.

Back blows can be very effective."
Deserves an award for this live saving act.
"hell yeah!! 
dude i choked once when i was by myself and i had to do the Heimlich to myself up against the kitchen counter , one of the scariest moments of my life. and then my dog ate the food that shot out of me  lmaooooo"
"As a nurse, I‚Äôve said many times that BLS or Basic Life Support skills should be taught to everyone. It should even be taught in school to children! This gives everyone baseline knowledge on how to recognize if someone is choking, doesn‚Äôt have a pulse and needs immediate medical attention, or how to properly do compressions during cardiac arrest. 

Could save a lot of lives."
"Did they cut the video short or something, or did he just squeeze him once?"
Thankfully you don‚Äôt have to spell it to do it.
That spelling of ‚Äúmanoeuvre‚Äù is brutal. Jesus.
"A GIGACHAD IS BORN.

Humbling whenever someone does something like this and remains calm."
"First off, amazing the boy recognized and assisted the kid. 

But why did they cut off the video before he finished? I saw him grab the kid from the side and use a single fist to grab him? Am I watching the wrong video?

Educate yourselves on how to assist in an emergency. Whether it is CPR, heimlich or even basic first aid you never know when you will be called upon."
Apparently Heimlich could hardly go anywhere without a succession of people coming up to him in tears thanking him for saving someone's life. How amazing to have made such a difference to the world!
Poor Isaiah standing there looking mortified while his buddy gets a commendation.
"I‚Äôve had this exact situation happen to me at the same age. I choked on a piece of steak and could not get air up or down. My mother was there and saved me with the Heimlich. It was the scariest experience i‚Äôve ever had. If my mom had not stepped in, I would not be here. The fact this little boy saved his friend, and knew what to do at this age, he is a truly a hero. Incredible. His family and friends should be incredibly proud.

I truly think the Heimlich is something everyone should know. There‚Äôs also information you can learn to save yourself if you‚Äôre ever alone and this happens (self-Heimlich/using side of table or ledge, etc)."
I wish adults payed attention.
How Dr. Heimlich came up with it: https://youtu.be/mLreMVNBSY8
"Kid took instant action and kept his cool. What a boss. 
I teach first aid and CPR to middle schoolers and show them videos like this to prove there‚Äôs always a chance they could be called on to save a life."
I had to save myself once when choking on a piece of bread. Alone in my apt. I used the upper corner of my desk chair. Learned it in a cpr class for work I think. Glad I was paying attention that day.
"Obligatory mention that it‚Äôs been referred to as *Abdominal Thrusts* for the past 20 years after multiple evidences that Dr. Heimlich has *exaggerated* many of his medical claims to the point all his children virtually disowned him and committed their lives to shedding light on their *complicated* father.

One thing Dr. Heimlich certainly did was advance something called ‚ÄúMalariatherapy,‚Äù where he intentionally gave HIV-positive patients malaria, which rapidly increased their physical decline."
"I saved my husband with the Heimlich in our kitchen years ago. He was trying to cough into the sink but nothing was coming out. I asked, are you choking? He nodded yes, and my 5'6 self Heimliched his 6'6 frame and after 3 thrusts it was out and we were both shocked and impressed. I'd literally only seen it on TV and was able to replicate it. If you can get past the ""what do i do?!"" thoughts, you can easily save a life. It was my chicken that almost killed him, so we are basically even lol."
"One of my kids started choking like that when she was about 5yo. We had met friends at the park and had a little outdoor lunch with nuggets. She kept standing up and dancing around because she was excited for the playground. Suddenly, she got a weird look on her face and I knew she was choking. 

I walked over and gave her the Heimlich and the bite of nugget flew out and hit the ground a few feet away. I dusted her off with the, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay! Now go play!‚Äù 

As soon as the kids were out of sight, my friend says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe how calm you were!‚Äù And I was wobbling my way to the ground with a panic attack. Sometimes, that‚Äôs how it goes."
Nice to see a human interest story about kids that isn't one paying off classmate's debt.
"In first grade, a kid at my lunch table started choking and another kid, wanting to help him but didn‚Äôt know the heimlich, started beating the shit out him. He eventually coughed up his food but was like you should have just gone for the stomach wtf. The school actually decided to teach us it after that."
Kennedy probably thinks the Heimlich maneuver is bullshit

How messed up is our healthcare system when an 8 year old has to be the one to save lives smh¬†
I had to scroll too far no one has yet said young Sheldon
"Chose Heimlich instead of prayer, damn atheist."
"Teachers didn‚Äôt pay attention to the kids eating to notice him choking, but plenty of smiles as they gather for HIS picture. I‚Äôd be embarrassed standing there taking a picture if I was a teacher."
"Every basic school should have first aid lessons because of reasons like this one! I have one when I was ~9 about things like applying bandages, heimlich, treating burns, poisoning, and how to call/handle an ambulance (ofcourse in theory). Even trying the bandages thing on each other. It wasn't a certified training, but a basic one so we could atleast help in cases of emergency. Honestly I think it's quite strange why I have never had any other first aid lessons in middle school. I even think towns and cities should organize first aid lessons a few times a year, advertise it as a free walk-in so adults who are interested but don't have enough money to also be able to learn this. First aid is important!"
"Are they calling it the ""Heimlich"" again?  I thought Dr. Heinlich petitioned to have his name name removed because so many people did it wrong.  I thought it officially became known as the ""Abdominal Thrust""."
Wow. That kid even LOOKS smart! What a hero!
"I somehow read this as ‚Äúboy saves 8 so the Heimlich‚Ä¶‚Äù

I just imaging just badass rapid fire Heimlich and worrying eating conditions.

Anyways, still impressive."
You know it's kinda impressive how certain things enter society's collective common knowledge. I doubt someone sat down and taught this kid the Heimlich maneuver. It must have been learned through seeing it performed in media.
"Friendly reminder you can choke while alone - please learn how to self rescue. I want to keep as many of y'all around as possible (so we can argue here on reddit together until the end of time). Be safe everyone

https://youtu.be/FEr9jjZ6fi8?si=J5Wys9pKOx4SJdAD"
I knew someone who was having both an allergic reaction and choking on a cupcake. Her throat was closing up either way so did the Heimlich once and that was enough thankfully.
"It's more of a gesture, really.

E: Slut Bunwalla downvoted me."
That is one clever little kid...I'm waiting for the first person to mention Young Sheldon.

Blah blah blah young sheldon
 But mom he wets the bed.
"Yet another instance of a whites capitalizing on black struggles. If Izaiah hadn't eaten the grape, Thomas wouldn't even have become famous! Also why is the heimlich maneuver named after a white man? Blacks have been choking on white nationalist rhetoric for years!!

Is that the one using the handbrake and a swift turn of the steering wheel?
"The sad thing I fully expect one or both kids to get punished for breaking an established rule (""you made noise/you stood up/you didn't raise your hand and tell an adult"")."
Not to be confused with the Heinrich maneuver where you bite down on a¬†potassium cyanide¬† capsule hidden in your tooth.

Did they have to make him look like such a fucking dork?
"Save one kid, its news.

I wonder how many of us learned the lesson of chewing your meat thoroughly the hard way? My first experience was around the same age with some leftover steak in the refrigerator. I barely chewed it and when I tried to swallow it just got stuck. Couldn't breathe and my family was all outside in the fields. I was lucky that I could still grab the tip of the meat with my fingers and I was able to pull it out. just a bit further down and it would have been a different story. Imagine how many of our ancestors were taken out by their dinner long after they killed it?
"As a doctor, did you learn which method is medically preferred? Heimlich or blows between the shoulder blades?"
"Damn, fuck yeah, good on ya!"
Username checks out
"I've been in a restaurant with 100+ people, and not one of them got up to help someone choking.

I had to run from the other side, pick the guy up out of his chair, and give him the heimlich.

I swear the friends he was with would have just sat there asking ""are you choking?"" even after he was blue on the ground."
"Everyone should take a basic first aid course. That's what made me confident in these types of situations. Most people have no clue what to do and freeze. To be fair, helping when you don't know shit is probably as good as doing nothing.

I've never dealt with choking but my daughter had a febrile seizure just a few weeks after I did my first aid course and I knew exactly what to do. We were at a family gathering and everyone was running around shouting like the place was on fire doing fuck all. I remember one person holding a phone in their hand yelling, ""someone call 9-1-1!"" Meanwhile I just calmly sat there and gently held her on my lap in the recovery position until it passed. If I hadn't been there I can only imagine what would have happened. Someone probably would have done the classic grab the tongue and choke them by accident, I'm sure."
"You're right, I've seen so many adults handle less serious situations worse."
"I had a lunch lady save my life when I get dared to eat a whole hamburger when I was like 7 years old. Shoutout to ‚ÄúMiss Poopsie‚Äù who tripled as lunch lady, preschool teacher, and photographer for my shitty little school. 

I saved my bosses life 5-6 years ago with a Heimlich maneuver. Two people were already with her watching her choke and were in pure panic, one looked at me and just eeked out a ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. I looked around, told her I was going to do it, and had to do it like 4 times before I got it right.  The scariest one was after 2 and 3 when she started fading, slowed movement, got real heavy My adrenaline was high at the moment it barely even registered to me what happened, afterward I was shaking and didn‚Äôt understand why, then almost cried.

Our CMO had the whole floor do first aid training including CPR right afterward, and it was good because someone shortly afterward had a seizure so we had folks trained what to properly do and she got medical help really quickly. 

Keep thrusting into their chest even if you don‚Äôt get it at first, at that point you might be someone‚Äôs only hope."
"> Even adults tend to panic in emergency situations.

It's a mix of ""I haven't done this before"" and ""If I do it wrong, I don't want to get sued"". A lot of places don't have Good Samaritan laws. Even in the places that do, fighting such a case is expensive and time consuming."
Agreed. I‚Äôm a nurse and have successfully performed the maneuver twice. Once in my job and once for my dad. So thankful I take the time to recert whenever it‚Äôs due.
"Heimlich claimed to have used his namesake maneuver to rescue a choking victim for the first time on May 23, 2016, when he was age 96, reportedly saving the life of a fellow resident of his senior living community, Patty Ris. However, in 2003, he told the BBC that he had used it for the first time on a man choking in a restaurant. His son, Peter M. Heimlich, said, ‚ÄúBoth ‚Äòrescues‚Äô were bogus.‚Äù

From his Wiki page."
Like how right before he died? Did he at least have a chance to sit down?
His grandson was my brother‚Äôs roommate in college.
Wow they should call it the Henry maneuver in his honour
"Cool fact! I will use this every time anyone mentions the Heimlich manoeuvre in the future üòá

I wonder how many people around the world have been saved by this one manoeuvre ü§î"
"I didn‚Äôt know this, what a cool fun fact. Hopefully it worked, if it didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll have to use this as a morbid fun fact lol"
He was also a big time asshole
I was listening to the NPR segment where they talked about it and called him on air too. He was an amazing man.
And my least favourite thing is that the Heimlich manoeuvre has been rebranded abdominal thrusts in the First Aid literature‚ÄîI was recently told by a professional but have not fact checked‚Äîbecause his family tried to copyright/trademark the name so they could earn money every time it was printed in a manual etc.
[The greatest story never told](https://youtu.be/cIErwK5o7Ss?si=94ARGdeD9rigD3A6)
I understand it was the only time he personally did the maneuver.
"Of course, it's Young Sheldon after all. :+"
"Wham, bam, thank you m'am"
"The insurance company should have given you 10k that day, I‚Äôve seen the hospital end of choking cardiac arrest and it‚Äôs sad and expensive care."
"Rough day for the wife. Not only did she choke, found out her life was worth only $20. Good work, man."
"100% 

In the UK they have a special awards ceremony for kids who save lives."
Like the one they showed him being presented with in the article?
Dog was just making sure you couldn't choke on it again
Yea that's my reaction. In the video he just pulled his shoulders back he didn't actually do the heimlich. I mean if it worked it worked but that video confuses me.
"I think I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúmanoeuvre‚Äù before, is that the U.K. spelling maybe?"
Just the British spelling
"I can't help but think of Eddie Izzard and his bit about Heimlich inventing his ""me manoeuver."""
It looks like someone dry heaving while saying maneuver
"yeah, seriously, it's like someone is trying to cast a spell"
Scrolled the whole thread to find this!
"hoocha hoocha hoocha,‚Ä¶.lobster"
I choked on a banana cut into a coin when I was home alone before as well. It's terrifying when you realize the only thing between you and death is yourself.
"To be clear, Kennedy is an idiot, but the actual science behind it is murkier than you might expect. Heimlich was known to market his maneuver and fund studies that would definitely support his procedure over actual science.

The consensus now days is that back blows should be done first, then switch to the Heimlich maneuver after five attempts. Except for the American heart association, which says Heimlich first.

Also, it should only be done when people are conscious but not breathing and only for those over 1 year old.

As with most things the actual science often makes things more nuanced, and striving to understand those nuances is what I wish all of us would do more often."
"I always wonder if the people who make these complaints are actively teaching things to the young people in their lives. I hear so much about how little ‚Äúthis generation‚Äù knows from my family members who threw the tv on in the other room so they didn‚Äôt have to deal with me. It‚Äôs your job to pass on knowledge to the next generation, just like someone in your life taught it to you."
"Definitely, I think this kid is in the minority sadly, very clever kid"
"I guess I‚Äôm just surrounded by exceptional young people, because I learn something ‚Äúnew‚Äù from them practically every time I‚Äôm around them.   

Maybe that‚Äôs because I enjoy engaging with them and respect their points of view, though.   Invariably, I find that they do the same for me in return.  

I‚Äôm impressed by them, tbh.  They‚Äôre smarter, earlier, than we were back in the olden days of the 1970s."
First thing I thought of
Is it not anymore??  I had to take CPR and Learn this in PE but also that was like 20 years ago lol
Don‚Äôt be so bloody Prussian :)

"Kinda beat yourself to the punch there, eh?"
"It was only one time, ONE TIME!"
\*chugs soda*
You've got the causality reversed.  It's the doughnuts that lead to the Heimlich.
Let's not be ridiculous. This kid isn't getting in trouble

Your comment makes you look like dork.
Realizing I never learned this lesson. I chew briefly and swallow chunks of meat. I‚Äôm hoping that this thread one day prevents my death since my New Year‚Äôs resolution is to chew longer.
"> just a bit further down and it would have been a different story.

For the future (and ideally this doesn't happen again), but _if you are_ stuck in a situation like that, throwing yourself down on the back of a chair or the edge of a table so it strikes you just under the ribs is effectively Heimlich-ing yourself."
"Not me - I actually never had an issue my whole life until a few years ago when in one year, it happened twice.  Thing is, it didn't go in my trachea (thank God) but got ledge in my esophagus.  Super painful, couldn't swallow, and caused constant dry-heaves.  

That's what I get for taking bites out of a whole cut of steak, rather than cutting it into bite-sized strips/pieces.  In my defense the second time I didn't have a knife."
"You really were lucky, under-chewed steak is a killer. One of my cousins choked to death on a piece of  steak on his birthday."
"I just don‚Äôt eat steak. Too much hassle to chew. 

Shave it thin, or grind it into a burger."
"I did the same thing! Didn‚Äôt chew my steak enough and it got stuck, but I was just able grab the tip of it and pull it out. After that, I started chewing steak until it‚Äôs barely even solid before swallowing.

It‚Äôs kind of insane that choking on food is just a thing that happens sometimes. You don‚Äôt chew enough and suddenly it‚Äôs a very dangerous situation."
"And be careful cutting your meat small

Mother's day lunch with my mom, was distracted by her talking, missed how big the steak piece was

Still embarrassed when I go back. The waitress who saved me looked like my mom's ex wife which was a trip"
"It's already taught in Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and Basic Life Support, the latter of which is required to become even an EMT, and the former is highly recommended. I just renewed both of mine. 

Blows between the shoulder blades are recommended for infants and neonates, the heimlich for basically anyone else.

Remember though, when someone goes unresponsive while choking, it's time to start CPR, whether they're pulseless or not. They're hypoxic enough to lose consciousness, cardiac arrest isn't far behind (especially for kids)."
"Current recommendations is to try 5 back blows and if that doesn‚Äôt work, move to abdominal thrusts."
"people are trained how to do it, but people dont really recognize when a person is in danger in some real life situations.

 I saw a wife one time who thought her husband was having an anxiety attack because he said he ""couldnt breathe"", but i knew he needed to go to the ER.

turns out he couldnt breathe because a 1 month old xray showed he had pleural effusion that was never treated and so the ER was able to drain a lot out to help him breathe again.

"I went off at my bf the other day because I was choking on a sweat, while he was just looking at me going ""what's wrong?"" Thankfully I managed to breathe the small amount of air I did have in my lungs out to expel it, but it was crazy scary"

">I've been in a restaurant with 100+ people, and not one of them got up to help someone choking.


Loudermilk has a scene like this where the ER doctor he's with refuses to help because of the liability."
"That's not panic.  That's apathy.  There are people I eat meals with that I'm not going to expend any effort to save.  Nor am I going to race across a room to save a complete stranger.

What's in it for me if I do?

What happens to me if I break their ribs, or fail to save them?

I'm more likely to suffer from saving someone else's life than I am to be rewarded.  No good deed goes unpunished."
I doubt the vast majority of people are worried about being. It‚Äôs the bystander effect and/or skill issue
"Literally every US state has Good Samaritan laws. If you're not an actively licensed and practicing medical professional, any lawsuit against you would be dismissed immediately if aid was rendered in good faith."
Either his son is right or a complete asshole why would you call your dad's two saves bogus? And besides dude invented a huge life saving move maybe let him have two bogus saves to prove it works
The chicken wing she was eating ricocheted off of a beer glass on the tray of a waitress and pierced his brain.  It literally ended his life.
And what does that make us?
Heimlich‚Äôs nephew was Potsie on Happy Days
I had to do it on myself once! Extremely painful but better than choking to death alone in a studio apartment.
"It gets more interesting the more you think about it. The only reason I remember that story specifically is because I was shocked the person who invented that maneuver was still alive. 

People have presumably been choking to death since the beginning of humanity. It really feels like  someone must have figured it out at some point before him."
"The Heimlich was ineffective for Heimlich, unfortunately"
"Yeah, always putting the squeeze on people."
He was legitimately a crazy person
Amazing in the sense that he was unhinged?
It was never officially called the Heinrich maneuver iirc
I‚Äôm old. Looks more like [Fuller](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/20thcenturyfox/images/b/bf/Home-Alone-Fuller.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160604164624) from Home Alone to me.
I promptly spent that $20 on Pokemon cards lol
Did read the article or watch the video? They had an award ceremony for the kid.
I heard an interview with him on the radio and he said he did yank on his stomach once and the grape popped out.
"I think you‚Äôre correct. Also, my comment wasn‚Äôt a jab at OP - just saying it‚Äôs tricky to spell either way."
"For the country that hates the French the most, the English sure keep a lot of their linguistic nonsense around."
"Oh man, I'd forgotten about him! I haven't watched his stuff in forever, thank you for the reminder, I know what I'm doing later"
"Of course not. They‚Äôre complainers, not doers"
"From what I've seen, the people who most often make these complaints are proudly ignorant and don't teach the next generations the little bit that they do know."
"Yup, I think people who wanted to mention him are downvoting me as I beat them to it üòÖ"
So. ¬†Still dresses oddly. ¬†I never seen a kid dress like this outside of tv characters who play nerds.¬†
"One lesson we never learn with food is to not to put extremely hot food in our mouth. Oh, you just took it out of the oven? Let me try a little bi.....OH MY GOD! MY TONGUE!"
"Remember that you can perform the Heimlich on yourself with the back of a chair or any other hard ledge. Being alone isn‚Äôt necessarily a death sentence but you have to act fast. 

You might want to consider getting a lifevac since you know you‚Äôre at a higher risk of choking."
"Chewing more also means you get to enjoy the food more, feels like you are eating more (helps if you are trying to lose weight), and improves digestion (less meat farts)."
Didn‚Äôt learn it from meat but I did choke on a pill. I literally just got on all fours and grabbed it out of my throat within maybe 2 seconds functioning completely on autopilot I didn‚Äôt even have a second to panic but it was intensely traumatic. Now I chew all my meat VERY thoroughly
"I had the same happen to me, where all of a sudden I was having food getting stuck in my esophagus. Went and got it checked out and turns out the issue was having acid reflux. Been taking omeprazole and haven‚Äôt had issues since. May be worth going to have it looked at if you are still having those issues every once in awhile!"
How does CPR help if there is something lodged in their airway? Does it dislodge it?
"> Blows between the shoulder blades are recommended for infants and neonates, the heimlich for basically anyone else.

In the UK you're taught to do shoulder blows first and then abdominal thrusts if the shoulder blows don't work.

And you are taught to do a two-finger abdominal thrust on a baby if back slaps don't work."
"when i first saw the fifth element and ian holm saving gary oldman by hitting him on the back, i didn't realize that was a real thing that works, until years later googling it. i had always thought the Heimlich was the only thing that would work

after that i thought the movie was 100% realistic"
"Similarly, it‚Äôs important to know the appropriate clues to signal when you‚Äôre experiencing these things. For chocking as an example, trying to do anything other than putting your hands around your throat is just going to lead to a game of charades. 

I imagine in your story, the husband often said he felt like he couldn‚Äôt breathe during anxiety attacks. This would train his wife to ignore the rather significant statement when it became literal."
"Something that always stuck with me from a first-aid course about people choking and the leading cause to them dying from it mostly comes from the victim.

Choking on food in a public setting is extremely embarrassing and most victims will downplay/pretend it‚Äôs fine whilst trying to remove themselves from the group to go deal with it in private.

Also why many victims in a choking incident are found in bathrooms.

If someone seems like they‚Äôre choking, and you can‚Äôt get a clear answer and they‚Äôre dodging the question or just trying to hand wave you off‚Ä¶. they‚Äôre choking and they need help immediately."
Dennis‚Äô face in that scene is gold
"Putting your hands on your neck/collarbone is the choking symbol, in case you'd feel safer having a clear way to communicate that if it happens again"
"From the males perspective on this, he's likely going to get yelled at either way and felt asking was the least scream-heavy option.


He would have got there, eventually. Probably somewhere after¬†""babe, why won't you just tell me what's wrong"" and ""babe, why are you turning blue.""


:)"
"That's honestly not far off, only real difference is that people who are actually choking are silent."
"If they'd like to sue me, better believe I'm shoving that meatball right back down their gullet and apologizing for the confusion."
If you're in the US you have Good Samaritan protections to not get sued
"The fuck?

>What happens to me if I break their ribs, or fail to save them

You would be covered under the Good Samaritan Act. But the Heimlich maneuver doesn't break ribs."
"Noted. I will not help you if you‚Äôre ever in need of it. That‚Äôs gonna be a pain, though, because now I will have to ask anyone I want to help with anything whether their Reddit handle is Galaxy_Ranger_Bob. Worth it though.

And before you say anything, yes I read the comment thread. I‚Äôd have felt bad for you if your response to the situation wasn‚Äôt to become a worse person, but since it was, I feel okay saying that I wish they‚Äôd sued you twice."
"Not just the bystander effect, but also a genuine freeze response. People forget that it's not just fight-or-flight response, it's fight/flight/freeze, and the latter is extremely common. Hell, I try to keep up on first aid courses and got plenty of them drilled into me via boy scouts, and when a friend of mine slashed his finger wide open with a utility knife one time I _still_ froze up for a few seconds before my brain rebooted and I went over to help get it cleaned up and bandaged."
"They don't all cover every scenario though. Some of them only cover things like CPR and controlled bleeding. Some even only cover off-duty first responders. 

More importantly though, quite a few people don't even know what good samaritan laws are, much less what their state covers or doesn't cover."
I mean the dad may be the asshole.
"""Two bogus saves to prove it works"" is pretty funny."

Presumably choking to death alone would be less awful in a bigger apartment.
Did you use a chair or what??
"> It really feels like someone must have figured it out at some point before him.

The Heimlich Maneuver is not the only way to dislodge something from someone's throat.

The American Red Cross still recommends starting with five back blows (between the shoulder blades), then try the Heimlich Maneuver, then alternate between them."
Yeah but they were of the wrong caste and accused of witchcraft.
Oh man

That‚Äôs not why‚Ä¶
"Lol, I actually did learn that lesson (a few times) so I‚Äôm feeling a bit less like a Neanderthal"
"Look up how to Heimlich yourself properly though. Smacking your ribcage into a solid edge just hurts and doesn't do anything to stop you from choking.

You want to hit the spot just under the ribs."
"Honestly, the video of the cop saving a kid with a life vac got me to buy one that day. Had an uncle choke to death on a piece of steak. Another reason to have one even if you don't live alone is if you're on the bigger side and someone can't get their arms around you right."
Keeping blood pumping at all is more important than oxygen intake at that point.
CPR is just as much about keeping blood moving as it is about oxygenation.
"CPR‚Äôs main purpose is to keep blood pumping, using any remaining oxygen that the body still has.¬†

A secondary effect is that the pumps could force air up the airway and dislodge the food.¬†"
"That's true here too, I just didn't mention it. Thanks for bringing it up!"
That‚Äôs because he is a golden god
"Dude, it‚Äôs so wild, I walked into a small open office space into someone choking, and didn‚Äôt even notice because I was in a rush. If someone who was right next to her wouldn‚Äôt have pointed it out to me it could have been the end for them."
I've been sued for saving someone's life.  I lost that lawsuit.  I'll never save anyone's life ever again.
"I *have* choked on food in a restaurant.  I had to *give myself* a heimlich over the back of a chair, because no one care enough to do anything about it."

Mind your own fucking business."
Yea exactly. I was considering ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù as part of the bystander effect for some silly reason when they are different¬†

I only read the first three words of your comment. So take that.
"It does, at least the old codgers. There's a group of fossilised fuckwits called ""l'Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise"" who believe they are in charge of deciding what is and isn't the French language and are obsessed with its ""purity"" (ie what goes in and out in the process of linguistic evolution). Of course, a language is only decided by what the population at large uses, so the AF can try all it likes but fails to curb the advent of neologisms and trendy social media terms. And so every so often, you'll hear about how one of those miserable old farts almost has a stroke while giving a speech about how ""spoiler"" shouldn't be used in French because it comes from English and that's Bad‚Ñ¢ and we should ackshually use ""divulg√¢cher"" which is nothing but a slapped-together combination of ""divulguer"" (divulge, reveal) and ""g√¢cher"" (to spoil, to waste) that didn't exist beforehand. But somehow the Brits are extremely chill about using French-based words and even consider it posh in certain circumstances, which is a lot more enjoyable to me at least

TL;DR there are indeed conservative old fogeys in France who wake up in a cold sweat whenever their beautiful language is besmirched by the foul mouths of the barbarians who lie across the Channel or elsewhere"
I thought it was because you got conquered by a Frenchman and he didn't speak any Anglo-Saxon.

"The guy saved countless lives around the world indirectly by pioneering the maneuver, but he didn't even save one person himself... what an asshole!  I hope he chokes"
"You have a really odd philosophy in life. Heimlich has gotten plenty of credit for his work, the life saving maneuver is literally named after him. Coming up with something good doesn't give someone carte blanche to lie about further accomplishments. Coming up with something good doesn't even automatically make someone a good person.

I'm not passing any judgment on Heimlich either way as I don't know him or his son - obviously. Just pointing out that OP's fun story may be a fabrication."
"sir h.b. wing, archduke of applebee"

"Nooo, we do it ironicallyyyy :(("
"There has been increasing evidence over recent years that the passive air exchange provided by chest compressions is sufficient during Cardiac arrest. Respirations are still beneficial, but when it's a single layperson, they'd rather you forego respirations in favor of high quality chest compressions. 

Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in your blood to circulate to your tissues. If your blood isn't circulating, then oxygenation isn't really going to help with anything. 

Chest compressions will increase intrathoracic pressure, and if someone is choking, that means they have a foreign body object in their lower airway. It's rare for a foreign body to make it's way past the Carina into the actual lungs. The Carina sits just behind the suprasternal notch, or the little divot right above your sternum on your chest. It's easy to palpate on anyone if you'd like to check it out. 

Every chest compression is going to compress the lungs and force air out. That means, in addition to pumping the heart with chest compressions, you're pumping the lungs as well. The only reason abdominal thrusts are preferred while they're conscious is because you're more effectively reaching the lungs by positioning your hand underneath the ribs, against the diaphragm. That motion effectively simulates a cough.

Chest compressions are recommended once they become unconscious because the loss of consciousness is due to hypoxia of the brain tissue. Their brain has been deprived of oxygen long enough for them to lose consciousness. The heart tissue normally doesn't last too much longer before it starts creating dysrhythmias and becoming disorganized. That's essentially what cardiac arrest is: disorganized, unproductive cardiac rhythms. Even if you did clear the airway after that point, if they've arrested, you still have to do CPR."
"They've changed the recommendation quite a few times over the years, and the most recent first aid course I've done for CPR in general has just been deep chest compressions, no rescue breaths at all. Prior to that it was 30 compressions to 2 breaths, and then a decade ago it was something like 10 compressions to 1 breath. Don't ask me why it's changed, I have no idea, I just know the most recent first aid course was ""don't bother with rescue breaths, just good compressions""."
"I broke the ribs of someone while performing CPR, which I was trained for until EMS arrived.

The person didn't recover.  I was sued by the family for the damage to their loved one, and causing them suffering while they died.  I ended up having to pay the costs of their funeral and punitive damages on top of that.

EMS were *also* sued.  That case was settled separately and the settlement is sealed.

My lawyer argued that the ""Good Samaritan Laws"" are supposed to protect me, but those were set aside by the judge in his instructions to the jury."
"Who do you believe? The guy who invented the thing and said he only had to use it twice

Or his son who randomly just said he made it all up? 

Why should we believe his son? He has no credibility 

And it's not OPs story"
Fun fact. Buffalo wings are made with 0 buffalo parts. It's named after the Bob Marley song.
"Sir, Are we being too literal?"
See? Nobody cares.
"During my first paediatric first aid session after COVID (I'm a Beaver leader) the leader showed some blood pressure charts for someone getting CPR in an operating room by a full team - and you can see the exact moment that they stop to do rescue breaths because the blood pressure drops right out. If a team like that (who I assume function like a F1 pit crew) can't maintain pressure during the rescue breaths, then what chance does a comparative neophyte like me, by myself, have?"
I touched my divot and my whole chest cracked what do
"The impression I've had is that since there's still some oxygen in their blood, it's way better to keep circulating that blood than it is to stop circulation.  There's no point in breaths if you have to stop compressions to do them."
My instructor said last year that they changed the guidelines because rescue breathing makes people less likely to administer CPR. This year rescue breathing is required and we all got CPR masks as part of the training.
"How did this not get thrown out because of the Good Samaritan Act? Did that come up during the lawsuit, and what did the judge say?"
"Why are you downvoted?

Stupid Redditors needs to maintain their ""hype train"" and don't like anyone presenting countering facts."
"The guy who invented the maneuver actually said he only had to use it once, at 96. That statement was proven false when an article about him claiming to have used it thirteen years prior was dug up. 

The son's claims also don't seem ""random"" - the son grew up with his father and knew him way better than the vast majority of people did. Certainly better than you or I do. He's also the one who pointed out the falsehood of his dad's original story, which led to papers issuing corrections back when this happened.

I don't think inventing a maneuver makes you any more credible when it comes to telling stories about encountering choking and helping victims. I am not 100% sure who to believe because, again, I haven't met either person here but I have enough doubt in the original story that I wouldn't retell it as a fun factoid myself."
That's a huge relief I always felt so bad about buffaloes having their lil wings clipped off
We ain't found shit!
"The judge gave instructions to the Jury saying ""The Good Samaritan act does not apply in this case.""   He did not elaborate, it was part of my lawyers defense."
"It doesn't fit their narrative of ""always be helpful.""

They also can't accept that CPR only succedes in only 5% of proper application when done in a timely manner."
"Naw

All claims and statements made by you are bogus

Sadly this type of headline is just never a surprise

"I am a firm believer that SAPR should be an independent civilian authority within the Federal Government instead of being tied to the DoD. They should have the power to investigate and charge *anyone* within their purview (which would be federal employees or contractors).

Name a more iconic duo than the Military and hiding sexual misconduct.
Anyone who knows the military knows this is their MO. I‚Äôve got multiple friends who‚Äôve been assaulted and abandoned by their higher ups.
He buried it at the academy? It would have been so much simpler to just have thrown the report overboard while at sea.
"‚ÄúMonths later, an email from a Coast Guard budget and programs official to the commandant‚Äôs executive assistant suggested the service take steps to remove all references of the investigation in materials prepared for Congress‚Äù

Ummm isn‚Äôt this supposed to not be able to happen? Why do government officials always feel so confident that this doesn‚Äôt happen and we see reports that it happens all the time? If it happened with this what about more serious issues?"
That's what the military always does.
I see Ron Johnson is going to assist in addressing these findings.  Which means - nothing will be corrected.  RJ might even try to make this a fundraising effort‚Ä¶.
"This is military leadership everywhere in the US. UNTIL decisions concerning pursuit,

All those bullshit platitudes they drill into about seeing the enemy before they see you or something similar and they are actually covering for the enemy, those dumb pieces of shit. Sorry rant over."
Just more reason women should protest by not joining the military. Remember Sarah Roque rip. Want that to be your daughter. Swept under a rug and lied about. By the good guys
The Coast Guard too? They were the one branch of the military I thought was pretty ok on these kind of things

And this wasn't him talking to me as a subordinate, but him drinking in a bar to a bunch of college students and law enforcement professionals while telling stories of his career.

"SAPR isn't meant to investigate, they support the victims. The DoD has established the Office of Special Trial Counsel which operates outside the normal chain of command for a set of the ""worse"" crimes (including sexual assault). 

This is a recent change that came about due to Congressional legislation after all the issues raised about Commanders hiding so much crap."
"SAPR is the victim support organization. They don't investigate. The branch investigation agency (CID, NCIS, OSI) does the investigation part."

I believe the person was referencing that the incoming administration appears to have a high number of sex offenders in it.
They should go to jail for this shit
Are you trying to tell us that a convicted rapist will actually take the moral high ground while also being given nearly absolute unchecked power? Really? REALLY?

Fucking lolololol"

"Trust me, you're good in that sub.  And make sure to read the top stories from all time, some of them are goddamned hilarious."
"The military is *decently* insulated from major changes on fronts like these as administrations change.¬† Remember that generals and admirals are promoted from existing ranks, not externally hired, so the military sorta self-governing in that sense.


I dunno, it's hard to explain unless you've seen the wheels turn yourself.¬† The military certainly is affected by changing administrations and leadership, but it's slower than people things and weirdly more progressive on these issues than you'd imagine."
"As someone who has a relative that has been in the Coast Guard for the past 10 years and was a victim of sexual assault during that time, things absolutely are changing.

The fact this is making the news is one of the first signs but a lot of the changes aren‚Äôt things that will make the news. Individual cases are being taken much more seriously. 5+ years ago most cases would end with the perpetrator being ‚Äútransferred‚Äù as their punishment. Now senior offices with decades of service are being dishonorably discharged (no benefits/pension).

That absolutely is huge and unless you‚Äôve got firsthand knowledge your pessimism is only circle-jerking and upvote grabbing.

Edit: it‚Äôs amazing people want to downvote actual events because it doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative. Miserable people want to keep the world miserable.

Double Edit: It‚Äôs really also quite great that people want to keep downvoting someone that has an immediate relative who was a victim of SA from a fellow Coastie. You‚Äôd rather keep pushing a story that fits your narrative even if it isn‚Äôt true.

THIS is another reason why SA victims in the armed forces are afraid to come out now. They are worried that people will just go ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the armed forces for ya‚Äù."
">That absolutely is huge and unless you‚Äôve got firsthand knowledge your pessimism is only circle-jerking and upvote grabbing.

>Edit: it‚Äôs amazing people want to downvote actual events because it doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative. Miserable people want to keep the world miserable.

Oof, that's hypocritical in many ways lol as you said, the miserable spread their misery

No one has voiced an opinion for you to be this offended by or to even respond to. It's also hugely ironic that you're accusing people of seeking upvotes, then getting butthurt you're being downvoted lol

Again, I'm not sure wtf you're arguing about, but it seems like you've put yourself in opposition to me. People will have different opinions than you (or you will assume as much with zero basis) throughout life; you can make it a lot easier on yourself if you learn to navigate that and have intelligent conversations instead of having a tantrum and accusing people of circle-jerking and going off about karma farming. No, bud. It's just that other people have different perspectives."
"That‚Äôs a bad day shopping.

> Troopers and local police followed the truck through the mall and engaged in gunfire with the suspect to end the threat, Washko said.

Thats some seriously Blues Brothers police work"
"""The use of excessive force is authorized in the apprehension of the Blues Brothers."""
"this story epitomizes why police chases shouldn't be allowed. they chased the guy for 19 miles down the highway, into a jc penny storefront, through a shopping mall, then shot him dead all while causing multiple injuries and massive property damage in their wake... for a possible DUI? the thing that's illegal because it *causes property damage, injury, and death*?


ideally every drunk driver would get arrested without incident, but if your method of detaining the suspect literally causes all of the horrible things you're trying to stop from happening to happen then there's gotta be a better course of action."
"Police chases are almost never necessary.  They had the dude's plates, they had his address, they knew who he was."
"I‚Äôm glad there were no fatalities other than the driver, hopefully the victims have a speedy recovery."
"Of course it‚Äôs Killeen, it‚Äôs always Killeen TX"
"Situation:  

>""There‚Äôs people in here shopping for their families, their children, their friends, loved ones ..."" 

Texas' insane solution:

>""The truck traveled 'several hundred yards' through the store as troopers and local police followed on foot and 'engaged in gunfire to eliminate this threat' ...

And that was AFTER chasing the guy for 19 miles because they got a call about him ""possibly being intoxicated.""  I'm certain he was very careful to drive slowly and safely in the attempt to elude the cops. (/s)

There is probably some universe in which any of this makes sense but it's not this one.   Chase a drunk whose judgment and inhibitions are the first things taken away by alcohol, followed closely by the ability to drive at all.  Then start blasting away in a shopping mall filled with holiday shoppers.

I'm waiting for the report on how many cars he hit during the chase and how many stray bullets have to be dug out of store walls and ceilings at the mall.  It's a miracle these idiots didn't kill a half a dozen innocent bystanders."
Killeen. Yeah makes sense.
"Police chasing people in vehicles should not be a thing or at least should be used very sparingly. If this dude had not been chased there wouldn‚Äôt be 6 injured people including children and a dead driver. Obviously homeboy made some bad decisions, but I have to think this kind of shit can be dealt with in a way that doesn‚Äôt literally make things way way worse than they would have been otherwise. There has to be a better way."
Was it The Blues Brothers?
"To be fair, that mall is a ghost town so I‚Äôm sure there weren‚Äôt many people in it"
Found the [footage](https://youtu.be/IIdGxR-aU6o?si=gNk1pBcZZGhD7_HH) of the police chase.
"Well, at least the cops only pursued on foot into the mall...

Scary AF though. I was in a building that a drunk crashed a truck through several years ago. Fortunately, no major injuries, but took a few stiff drinks to be able to sleep that night."
I had visions of the ‚ÄúBlues Brothers‚Äù getting car chased through the mall.

"Totally read this as ‚ÄúThe use of excessive force is authorized for apprehension at Brooks Brothers.‚Äù

But then I didn‚Äôt know if there were Brooks Brothers stores anymore but they have a JCPenney at this place."
The Blues Brothers need to file a lawsuit. That's¬†their bit. They'll get those nuns their money through the courts!
"So what I‚Äôm hearing is, they had 19 miles worth of opportunities to take the guy down but instead chose to do so in the worst fucking spot possible, a fucking mall, during holiday season no less, then just walked it off like it was just another day despite the countless civilians that got dragged into it."
"This guy *might* hurt someone driving while drunk, so the cops make sure they hurt someone.¬†


Well done"
"Washington state has already tried and demonstrated that banning chases simply does not work. 

The real question is why so few police departments have the grappler system installed on their vehicles.

I highly doubt it's a budget issue."
"I use to believe police chases were bad for the reasons you listed. But I have come around to be supportive of more aggressive policing because you need deterrence to keep crime down before it reaches a critical mass.   
  
Living in a big city and seeing the crime around me committed so brazenly, I do not believe the often repeated delusion that crime is down. Arrests and prosecution are down. Crime is way up and its because we stopped making an example of criminals."
"""there's gotta be a better course of action.""


You mean civil forfeiture & qualified immunity?"
"This is why the police rarely engage in chases up here. They will begin a pursuit, if need be, but more often, they curtail the operation when they grasp that the  pursued driver may endanger other vehicles or persons."
"In a couple of weeks, you‚Äôll pick him up in Seattle or someplace, working in a car wash. - There‚Äôll be no fight and nobody else will get hurt."
Having plates isn't enough for an arrest or tickets for the traffic violation they committed. The most you can do is a owners liability ticket and it may be issued to the person who wasn't even driving.
"Necessity is subjective, so I'm not going to touch that... the second part of your comment is true in theory, but is rarely the case, and is a good example of how ignorant the average person is about crime. Criminals don't usually have vehicle in their own name, the address on the tag is almost never where they live. Unless you see the driver and personally know him, you don't know who the person is..."
Right. And magically they also knew exactly who was driving.
"That was back in the olden days. Cereal just doesn't have the same incentive today as it used to. Plus it's gotten a bit pricey. Now, they just hand them out with low IQ test scores, along with gang tattoos, blue arm bands and abused women and minors."

But instead the movie is like ""we have them right were it's safe to shoot them down but let's wait until they're over New York City to really maximize casualties."""

"> countless civilians that got dragged into it.

More like run over than dragged, although I'm not sure which is worse"
"Minneapolis they've banned chases except for a known to be violent or is an immediate threat to public and if doing so will not cause additional safety issue to the public.

Still have car chases that cause damage but one suspect was on a armed robbery binge from morning and between two different cities. I think he had robbed 4 locations by the time the chase was on."
"Now reconcile that thought with the multi-billion dollar police budgets allocated by major cities across the US and realize the police are just grifting while not doing their fucking jobs.

I also love the genius take that statistics must be wrong because my belief doesn‚Äôt align with what they‚Äôre telling me."
I do my own work. I don't figure the best way to do that is to close my eyes and then hope he gets picked up in Seattle!
"No, but most often they will pair it with cell phone data and/or surveillance footage that clearly puts the individual behind the wheel during the incident, which is plenty to charge with reckless driving or something similar. Chases are not necessary unless the suspect is on a violent rampage."
">Criminals don't usually have vehicle in their own name, the address on the tag is almost never where they live.

"Minneapolis is also the 4th most dangerous city in the US, which makes it an absolute horrible example to back up your point with. Getting rid of that shit in Washington at least made it bearable to live here.

Thousands of years of human history has shown that decriminalization does not work, because human nature is selfish."
"The statistics are wrong because they are wrong. You can try to be enlightened all you want but don‚Äôt be willfully ignorant.

Edit: Also don‚Äôt try to straw man me into defending the overwhelming level of police corruption in this country. I won‚Äôt do it. I would love massive reform and oversight. It is just in this one very narrow topic, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as clever of a strategy as we would like for it to be, to let people break the law and drive away. I use to think it was. Now I see what happens in my neighborhoods and I am willing to admit I was wrong."
I can‚Äôt believe the downvotes. I guess no one agrees with Sheriff Teasel.
"That's if you can even get access to that or if there is footage. Phone companies, especially Apple, are very peculiar with giving Police access to their phone data. And cell phone service isn't enough to put the PERSON in the DRIVERS seat. He could argue he was in the passenger seat or left his phone in his vehicle and if that's all the proof you have, that ain't enough for court. Surveillance footage isn't reliable because footage quality, and smaller cities don't have a prevalence of cameras around the city. And where the driver came from is completely unknown. And if it occurs at night, it'll be difficult to even get a description of the driver in the vehicle due to terrible lightning. There's also been issues in the past with Surveillance cameras being used to issue out tickets and some states don't even allow it.

Also not allowing Police chases have been proven to increase crimes. My cities department about over a decade ago implemented a no pursuit policy and there was a crime spike increase every single year, especially in carjackings, that did not stop until it was a year or two afterwards it was changed to a partial pursuit policy. The KIA boys became a thing in my city and ask any resident in Milwaukee how they feel about them."

"Oh we are playing the literal game when it was clear I was introducing levity into a somber event. I‚Äôll bite since there‚Äôs a lack of social intelligence in this particular conversation. When taken at face value, I stated there were probably not alot of people in it due to the mall not getting a lot of traffic, that‚Äôs a quantitative statement, not a qualitative one. I never said a word about it being better or worse that any person was injured, just an observation that there was not a lot of traffic at the location. Obviously any innocent people being hurt isn‚Äôt a good thing. Dark events and humor don‚Äôt create a false dichotomy. Have a happy holidays my friend."
